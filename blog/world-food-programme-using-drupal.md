# World Food Programme using Drupal

The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) (and [Mollom](https://mollom.com)) for the [World Food Programme](http://wfp.org). The World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian organization. With almost 12,000 people working for the World Food Programme, their food assistance reaches an average of 100 million people in 80 countries every year.

It is a stunning Drupal 6 website built by [Phase2 Technology](http://phase2technology.com) and [Development Seed](http://www.developmentseed.org). *Awesome!*
