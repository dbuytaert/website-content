HTML5 is about to rock our world. There are books written about why that is the case, but simply put, it can provide a much better user experience on both desktop and mobile devices, and could lead to a convergence between native applications and the mobile web.

I believe in [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) enough that I wanted to make it one of the top 5 initiatives for Drupal 8; and switch Drupal's default doctype from XHTML to HTML5. This is the fifth official Drupal 8 initiative after the [Configuration Management](https://dri.es/configuration-management-in-drupal-8), [Design](https://dri.es/design-for-drupal-8), [Web Services](https://dri.es/web-services-in-drupal-8) and [Multilingual initiatives](https://dri.es/multilingual-support-in-drupal-8).

I have asked [Jacine Luisi](https://www.drupal.org/user/88931) to be the *Initiative Owner* for the Drupal 8 HTML5 Initiative. Jacine is a prolific themer and contributor known to be a markup/CSS nut. I'd also like to recognize [Jen Simmons](https://www.drupal.org/user/140882) for all her evangelism work on HTML5 in Drupal. I hope that work continues as it can feed into the HTML5 Core Initiative.

The way we'll approach this initiative is by starting off with some of the low-hanging fruit, and gradually work our way up to more advanced parts of the specification. In [her announcement blog post](https://jacine.net/post/5614672142/html5), Jacine provides a plan for what that means.

To keep track of what is going on, tune into the core issue queue on [issues tagged HTML5](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?version%5B%5D=8.x&issue_tags=html5) or participate in the [HTML5 group](https://groups.drupal.org/html5). Details will be posted shortly on the [core initiative homepage](https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-initiatives).
