# Francesca Battistelli using Drupal

Francesca Battistelli is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for her official website at <http://francescamusic.com>. The site is built by her record label [Warner Bros Records](http://www.warnerbrosrecords.com/) (also a Drupal site), and is one of the best looking artist sites that I have seen. *Nice!*
