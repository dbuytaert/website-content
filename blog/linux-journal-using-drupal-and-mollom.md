[Linux Journal](http://linuxjournal.com) is a monthly magazine focused specifically on Linux. Linux Journal [switched to Drupal in 2005](https://www.drupal.org/node/15223), and hasn't looked back since. Last year in October of 2008 [Linux Journal](http://linuxjournal.com) decided to turn to [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect their site against spammers.

In [a case study on Mollom.com](https://www.mollom.com/blog/keeping-the-heart-of-the-linux-community-open-online), Linux Journal Webmistress [Katherine Druckman](http://www.katherinedruckman.com/) looks back at one year of using [Mollom](https://mollom.com), and explains how Mollom has helped the Linux Journal staff focus on building community, rather than having to deal with spam.

To give you an idea of how much pain spammers can inflict (and how much Mollom can help); there have been many days when Mollom has blocked almost 10k spam attacks against the Linux Journal website. Last year, Mollom blocked more than 1.5 million spam messages for Linux Journal alone.

Linux Journal was the first magazine to be published about Linux, and has been an important contributor to Linux' adoption. I started reading Linux Journal back in 1997, and I still read it today. We want these kind of publications to be wildly successful in promoting Open Source software. So on rainy Mondays like today, it is stories like this, that motivate me to work on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Mollom](https://mollom.com), and that make me hate spammers even more.
