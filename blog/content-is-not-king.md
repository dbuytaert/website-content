# Content is NOT king

According to Andrew Odlyzko's research people are more interested in communication than they are in content. In [Content is NOT king](http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/), Odlyzko writes:

> The Internet is widely regarded as primarily a content delivery system. Yet historically, connectivity has mattered much more than content. Even on the Internet, content is not as important as is often claimed, since it is e-mail that is still the true "killer app". The primacy of connectivity over content explains phenomena that have baffled wireless industry observers, such as the enthusiastic embrace of SMS (Short Message System) and the tepid reception of WAP (Wireless Application Protocol).

I wonder how this translates to the adoption rate of internet applications? Will content management systems with a focus on user interaction and syndication (eg. community software like [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)) grow faster than content management systems that focus solely on delivering content (eg. conventional broadcasting systems)? *I think so, yes.*
