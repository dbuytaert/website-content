Some of you may have noticed I've not been using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) for my personal website. Some of those have been pestering me about it for over three years. Worse. Some have gone as far as making bets as when I would convert my personal website to Drupal. Well, it took me over five years, but finally, I'm using Drupal for my personal website.

I've also decided to start blogging. I hope this website can be a platform for some of my thoughts and that it can give me an outlet to write about Drupal, and anything else I'm passionate about. Besides, I've been lurking around in the blog community for far too long ...

So if you find yourself reading this, welcome to my new Drupal-powered blog.

Note that effort is being put in creating a better website design, and that the functionality will be tweaked and extended along the way. I do not intend to enable user registrations at this point, but you can leave a comment without having to register.
