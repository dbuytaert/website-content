Next week, on Monday October 15th, I'll give an evening presentation about Drupal for [FITCE](http://fitce.be/), the Federation of Telecommunications Engineers of the European Union. The event starts at 18.30h in the De Romree (Grimbergen, Belgium). Feel free to stop by if you are a Drupal user, or interested in learning about Drupal or Open Source software development. [Registration is required.](http://fitce.be/pamphlet071015.htm)
