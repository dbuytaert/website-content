On April 26th, [C.H.I.P.S.](http://www.chipsvzw.be/) organizes [a debate](http://www.chipsvzw.be/mom/) that focuses on the impact of user generated content on traditional media, publishers and cultural organizations.

They lined up an [impressive list of speakers and attendees](http://www.chipsvzw.be/mom/participants.php), including people like [Bob Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Young) (former CEO of RedHat and CEO of LuLu.com) and [Loïc Le Meur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loic_Le_Meur) (blogger and former director SixApart).

And What is best? The event conveniently takes place in my home town of Antwerp (Belgium).

I'm pretty convinced that by now traditional media organizations have what they desperately needed: [a clue](https://dri.es/content-is-not-king) – but I'll bring my big foam cluebat nonetheless, I'll wear [my NowPublic advisor hat](https://dri.es/tag/nowpublic) and I'll bring [a number of community experts](https://www.drupal.org/). ;)
