Last week in San Francisco, Jay and I spent some time at the Wired office with Wired's Michael Calore and Scott Loganbill. Of course, we took this as an opportunity to evangelize [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) so we sat down in [Wired's Webmonkey zoo](http://www.webmonkey.com) to talk about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com). Check out [the transcript of our conversation](https://www.wired.com/blog/Drupal_s_Creator_Envisions_Web_Publishing_s_Plug-and-Play_Future/) that was published on [webmonkey.com](http://www.webmonkey.com). *Thanks for the office tour Michael and Scott!*
