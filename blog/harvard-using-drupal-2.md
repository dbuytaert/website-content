# Harvard using Drupal

I recently learned about the fact that the [Berkman Center for Internet and Society](https://cyber.harvard.edu/) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). The *Berkman Center for Internet and Society* is a research center founded at Harvard Law School whose fellows included internet gurus like David Weinberger, John Perry Barlow, Dave Winer, Jimmy Wales, Doc Searls and many more.

Other notable Drupal sites at Harvard are the website of the [Science and Engineering department](http://www.harvardscience.harvard.edu/), the website of the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/) (they aim to solve major problems that affect society and the well-being of human populations), the website of [Initiative in Innovative Computing](http://wax.lib.harvard.edu/collections/wayback.do?lang=eng&coll=81&liveWebUrl=iic.seas.harvard.edu&stamp=20140422002601) (a center of expertise in solving very difficult computing problems), and last but not least [Harvard Magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/) (a magazine that keeps 240,000 alumni connected to the university). Harvard Magazine is also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com).
