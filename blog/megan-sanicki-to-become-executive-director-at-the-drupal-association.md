This is a time of transition for the [Drupal Association](http://assoc.drupal.org). As you might have read on the Drupal Association blog, [Holly Ross, our Executive Director, is moving on](https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/holly.ross.drupal/hello-world-goodbye-drupal-association). Megan Sanicki, who has been with the Drupal Association for almost 6 years, and was working alongside Holly as the Drupal Association's COO, will take over Holly's role as the Executive Director.

Open source stewardship is not easy but in the 3 years Holly was leading the Drupal Association, she lead with passion, determination and transparency. She operationalized the Drupal Association and built a team that truly embraces its mission to serve the community, growing that team by over 50% over three years of her tenure. She established a relationship with the community that wasn't there before, allowing the Drupal Association to help in new ways like supporting the Drupal 8 launch, providing test infrastructure, implementing the [Drupal contribution credit system](https://dri.es/a-method-for-giving-credit-to-organizations-that-contribute-code-to-open-source), and more. Holly also matured our [DrupalCon](https://dri.es/tag/drupalcon), expanding its reach to more users with conferences in Latin America and India. She also executed the [Drupal 8 Accelerate Fund](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-8-accelerate-fund), which allowed direct funding of key contributors to help lead Drupal 8 to a successful release.

Holly did a lot for Drupal. She touched all of us in the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org). She helped us become better and work closer together. It is sad to see her leave, but I'm confident she'll find success in future endeavors. Thanks, Holly!

Megan, the Drupal Association staff and the Board of Directors are committed to supporting the Drupal project. In this time of transition, we are focused on the work that Drupal Association must do and looking at how to do that in a sustainable way so we can support the project for many years to come.
