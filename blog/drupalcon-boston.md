# DrupalCon Boston

Good news! The next Drupal conference (DrupalCon) will take place in Boston from March 3-6. If you want to learn more about Drupal, or if you want to capture and absorb the passion and enthusiasm behind the Drupal project, this is the place to be.

The last Drupal conference, [DrupalCon Barcelona](https://dri.es/drupalcon-barcelona-wrapup), was capped at 450 people and sold out so this time around, we're trying to accommodate 700 Drupal people. Yes, these numbers blow my mind.

In other words, DrupalCon Boston will bring together hundreds of Drupal users and developers from all around the world. Whether you are a Drupal professional or an enthusiastic user coming to find out more, you're invited to [join us in Boston](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org).

Furthermore, DrupalCon is being held at the same time/place as [AIIM International Exposition &amp; Conference](http://www.aiimexpo.com/aiimexpo2007/v42/index.cvn?id=10197), the largest content management technology conference in North America. The goal: introduce Drupal to thousands of potential new Drupalers.

Organizing a conference of this size obviously takes a lot of resources; if you are interested in being a sponsor, please get in touch. Kudos to the DrupalCon Boston team and the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) for taking on this massive amount of work. This is not something we should take for granted. *Thanks!*
