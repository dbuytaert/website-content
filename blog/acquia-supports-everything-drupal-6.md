# Acquia supports everything Drupal 6

Last year, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) opened for business, offering commercial support for a defined software distribution called [Acquia Drupal](https://www.acquia.com/web-content-management-drupal). One could purchase commercial support for all the modules in Acquia Drupal. As I mentioned last week in my [2009 predictions for Drupal](https://dri.es/predictions-2009), one of the things we learned relatively fast is that people wanted more than just Acquia Drupal. They wanted support for all modules, themes and custom code.

No surprise, but when we set out to build Acquia little more than a year ago, we weren't quite sure how we'd go about supporting everything with the limited resources we had available. We have since learned and grew a lot, and we decided that we're finally ready to start providing technical support for all of Drupal 6.x – not just Acquia Drupal but all modules and themes available on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org), as well as custom code.

So last week we rolled out a big release of the [Acquia Network](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network), the new [Acquia Network connector](https://www.drupal.org/project/acquia_connector) (available from drupal.org, see [Gabor's blog post for details](http://hojtsy.hu/blog/2009-jan-05/third-party-service-modules-drupalorg-it-makes-lot-sense)), a [156 page "Getting Started Guide" on Drupal](https://dev.acquia.com/downloads), and a ton of new content on our website. Starting today, we're ready to give many more customers what they want: support for everything Drupal 6.

We'll continue to tweak and experiment with our offering in 2009 so we didn't make a big deal out of this change (i.e. no press release, no analyst briefings). However, I wanted to bring this to your attention because I'm really excited about it. It means it will be easier for us to help take Drupal to the enterprise, and that Acquia will contribute to more and different parts of the [Drupal project](https://www.drupal.org).

While [Acquia Drupal](https://www.acquia.com/web-content-management-drupal) no longer defines our support boundaries, it is still a great on-ramp for people getting started with Drupal. We are continuing to invest in Acquia Drupal so watch this space for more Acquia Drupal announcements.

Kudos to the entire Acquia team for making this milestone happen. *Thanks!*
