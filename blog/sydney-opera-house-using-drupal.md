# Sydney Opera House using Drupal

[image australia-2024/sydney-opera-house caption=false]

Across its 50-year history, the [Sydney Opera House](https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/) has welcomed musicians, dancers, actors, playwrights, filmmakers, contemporary artists, and thinkers who have both challenged and defined the cultural scene. As a result, the Sydney Opera House draws millions of visitors from around the world each year.

Not only is the Sydney Opera House of incredible cultural importance, it's also an architectural masterpiece. Its unique design makes it one of the most iconic buildings in the world, and has earned it a place as a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/).

Last year, the Sydney Opera House chose to migrate its website to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). Today, it is running Drupal 10. The decision by such a prestigious institution to relaunch their website on Drupal highlights Drupal's flexibility, security, and ability to manage complex websites.

A couple of weeks ago, during [my visit to Australia](https://dri.es/drupal-adventures-in-japan-and-australia), I met with the Drupal team at the Sydney Opera House. I was particularly impressed by the team's dedication to using Open Source to expand cultural access and their enthusiasm for collaborating with other arts and cultural organizations. Their focus on innovation, inclusivity, and collaboration perfectly aligns with the core values of Open Source and the [Open Web](https://dri.es/tag/open-web). Drupal is such a great solution for them!
