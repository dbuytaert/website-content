File this under "better late than never". Before the year closes out, I wanted to post my 2015 DrupalCon Barcelona keynote video and slides. I archive all my DrupalCon keynotes on my site so anyone who is interested in taking a trip to memory lane or studying the evolution of Drupal, can check out [all my previous DrupalCon keynotes](https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal).

My DrupalCon Barcelona keynote is focused on having a realistic, open and honest conversation about the state of Drupal. In it, I broke down my thoughts on Drupal's market position, development process, and "decoupled Drupal". You can [watch the recording of my keynote](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7v_rv346qmM) or [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2015.pdf) (PDF, 27 MB).

In addition, here are three related blog posts I wrote about the [future of decoupled Drupal](https://dri.es/the-future-of-decoupled-drupal), [having to pick a JavaScript framework for Drupal](https://dri.es/should-we-decouple-drupal-with-a-client-side-framework), and a [proposal for how to evolve our development process](https://dri.es/always-be-shippable), which will allow us to ship new features every 6 months rather than every 4-5 years.
