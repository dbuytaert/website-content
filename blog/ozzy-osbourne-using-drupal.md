# Ozzy Osbourne using Drupal

Ozzy Osbourne, lead singer of Black Sabbath, man of tattoos, and bat-biting Prince of Darkness, is now using Drupal at [ozzy.com](https://www.ozzy.com/). *Rock!*

The site was built by Sony BMG. To learn more about how Sony is using Drupal, listen to [this Lullabot podcast with Doug Gottlieb of Sony BMG](https://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/lullabot_podcast_no_39_doug_gottlieb_of_sony_bmg_records).
