# Announcing Spark: authoring improvements for Drupal 7 and Drupal 8

At DrupalCon Denver, I announced the need for a strong focus on Drupal's authoring experience in [my State of Drupal presentation](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-march-2012). During [my core conversation](https://denver2012.drupal.org/content/directions-drupal-core) later in the week, I announced the creation of a Drupal 7 distribution named "[Spark](https://www.drupal.org/project/spark)" (formerly code-named "Phoenix"). The goal of Spark is to act as an incubator for Drupal 8 authoring experience improvements that can be tested in the field.

I hope for Spark to provide a "safe space" to prototype cutting-edge interface design and to build excellent content tools that are comparable with the experience of proprietary alternatives. While not a final list, some initial thinking around the features we want to experiment with is:

- Inline editing and drag-and-drop content layout tools ("true" WYSIWYG)
- Enhanced content creation: auto-save, save as draft and more
- Useful dashboards for content creators
- Mobile content authoring and administration support

The vision behind the Spark distribution is to be *"the [Pressflow](http://www.pressflow.org/) of Drupal authoring experience"*. Pressflow provided a "spoon" of Drupal 6 with various performance enhancements that made their way into Drupal 7 core while it was in development. The same improvements were made available to Drupal 6 users so they could easily be tested in the field. With Spark, we want to test authoring experience improvements in Drupal 7 on real sites with real users and real content. We also want to target the best improvements for inclusion into Drupal 8 core.

I'm excited to announce that Acquia will fund the Spark distribution. Core developers [Gábor Hojtsy](https://www.drupal.org/user/4166) and [Wim Leers](https://www.drupal.org/user/99777) will work on Spark full-time starting in late May. They will work along side [Angie Byron](https://www.drupal.org/user/24967) (webhchick), [Alex Bronstein](https://www.drupal.org/user/78040) (effulgentsia), myself and other members at Acquia. While we have some promising candidates so far, Acquia is still seeking two applicants to join the Spark team (with a strong preference to candidates located in or willing to move to the Boston area):

- Drupal UX Interaction Designer, who can conceptualize and prototype cutting-edge interface design.
- Senior Front-End Engineer, who eats, sleeps, and breaths JavaScript and jQuery (Drupal experience optional).

The Spark team will collaborate with the Drupal usability and the core development teams.
