[Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com) recently launched another cool [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) site: [Sun Learning Exchange](https://slx.sun.com/). The site enables Sun employees to easily publish rich media training content such as videos, podcasts, and documents to be accessed by all Sun employees and customers. Media can be rated, sorted, and tagged by site members and is automatically transcoded and hosted on LimeWire. The site was built with the help of our friends at [Chapter Three](http://www.chapterthree.com). *Sweet!*
