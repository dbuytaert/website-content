"Get your HTTPS on" because [Chrome will mark all HTTP sites as "not secure" starting in July 2018](https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html). Chrome currently displays a neutral icon for sites that aren't using HTTPS, but starting with Chrome 68, the browser will warn users in the address bar.

Fortunately, HTTPS has become easier to implement through services like [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), who provide free certificates and aim to eliminate to complexity of setting up and maintaining HTTPS encryption.
