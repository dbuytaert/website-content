# $70,000 USD for Drupal innovation contest

[image drupal/pitch-burgh-70000 resize=false]

Do you have a great idea to improve Drupal's software or community? The [Pitch-burgh innovation contest](https://dri.es/shark-tank-meets-drupal) provides you with the perfect opportunity to pitch your idea for a shot at receiving funding.

In the past week, we've raised an impressive $70,000 USD for this contest thanks to the generous support of the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) and our sponsors, including [1xInternet](https://www.1xinternet.de//), [Digital Polygon](https://www.digitalpolygon.com/), [ImageX](https://imagexmedia.com/), [Palantir](https://www.palantir.net/), [Skilld](https://www.skilld.cloud/), [Zoocha](https://zoocha.com/), and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/). We greatly appreciate their contributions, which will help fuel innovation for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).

While this is a fantastic start, we're not done yet! We still hope to raise more funds, so please don't hesitate to reach out to the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) or to [contact me](https://dri.es/contact) if you're interested in contributing.

The judges will award funding to the most exciting and impactful proposals that could make a difference in the Drupal community. Whether you have a new feature to improve Drupal's reach with [ambitious site builders](https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-site-builders), or an innovative design to improve Drupal's user interface, we want to hear from you!

We're hoping that this funding update will inspire you to [participate](https://www.drupal.org/association/pitch-burgh-innovation-contest). Remember, video submissions only need to be 2 minutes and 30 seconds long. The submission deadline is May 25th, which gives you almost 4 weeks to prepare. The winners will be announced at [DrupalCon Pittsburgh](https://events.drupal.org/pittsburgh2023), but you can enter the contest even if you're not going to DrupalCon Pittsburgh. Everyone is invited to pitch! For detailed guidelines on how to participate, please visit [the original announcement](https://dri.es/shark-tank-meets-drupal).

We're excited to see your submissions!
