With the help from [pingVision](http://pingv.com/), [Popular Science](http://popsci.com) relaunched using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). This move is notable, not only because [Popular Science](http://popsci.com) is a popular website, but also because they moved from [Vignette v7](http://vignette.com) (a proprietary content management system) to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) (an open source content management system).

According to a [recent press release](http://www.vignette.com/portal/site/us/menuitem.62215d74e262b2ba32189210180141a0/?vgnextoid=af1ebf03318a7110VgnVCM1000005610140aRCRD&vgnext-selected-menuitem=191626ff2f7512e8fb3d8010180141a0&gbl-vcmprguid=af1ebf03318a7110VgnVCM1000005610140aRCRD), Vignette's revenue for 2007 was down 3% compared to 2006, and their licensing revenue was down more than 15%. One data point doesn't constitute a trend, but to me, it is further proof that Open Source content management systems are gaining market share. Just last year, Drupal grew by more than 200%.
