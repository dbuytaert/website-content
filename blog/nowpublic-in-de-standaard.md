Belgian newspaper [De Standaard](http://www.standaard.be/) (read daily by 80,000 people in [Flanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders)) picked up the [news about NowPublic's series A funding](https://dri.es/nowpublic-gets-10.6-million-usd) and published a one-page article on [NowPublic](http://nowpublic.com) and citizen journalism.

As my photos illustrate, professional journalists and media companies need to loosen up a little or they might go numb. Amateur journalists have learned to drive; it's almost time to hand over the keys – or at least, to let us be the co-pilot. Denial will not protect the barricades around your [residual self image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_self_image).
