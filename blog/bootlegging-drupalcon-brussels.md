# Bootlegging DrupalCon Brussels

In 2004, the [Beastie Boys](http://www.beastieboys.com/) gave 50 video cameras to fans and [asked them to record the same concert](http://www.wired.com/2006/04/from-the-lips-to-your-ears/?pg=4). Then the 100-plus hours of footage was edited into [one film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488953/). Brilliant.

So ... we'll try do the exact same at [DrupalCon Brussels](/drupalcon-brussels). The upcoming conference holds the unique opportunity to capture a lot of sessions on video and [Norbert Fuerst](http://fuerstentum.net/) has offered his services to do post production on *all* footage through his video production company.

Norbert explains:

> I will take the responsibility to get the best out of your tapes, and I ask you to bring your DV video camera to DrupalCon Brussels. There is no need to be afraid about shooting video even if you're not that experienced – just a few rules I'll tell in advance and we're set up. If you have tripod, bring it. I really hope we'll get (at least) two cameras per session, and the sooner we known who's going to shoot, the better we can set up positions and procedures.
> 
> I did only a rough calculation, but it seems DrupalCon Brussels will offer some 48 hours of content and there is no way to attend more than one third of the sessions. Hence covering as much as possible of this event on video should not only help the ones staying at home but also those who attend different sessions. It should also make a good library for those who'll join Drupal in future – 48 hours of video isn't exactly nothing, but with some proper compression this should fit in 15 GB of server space or on 24 DVDs ...

In other words: bring your camera, a tripod, and a lot of tape. We'll label all the tapes and ship them to Norbert in sealed plastic bags. We need at least 6 persons (but preferably more) with a camera to cover the entire event. Oh, and I'll try to provide special t-shirts for the camera crew.
