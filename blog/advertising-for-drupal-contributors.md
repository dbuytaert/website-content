Today, [Acquia](https://acquia.com) announced how it will support [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) in [these challenging times](https://dri.es/sustaining-the-drupal-association-in-uncertain-times). In his blog post, [Mike Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mpsully/), Acquia's CEO, lists [Acquia's many contributions to Drupal](https://www.acquia.com/blog/supporting-drupal-amid-covid-19).

One contribution that I'm very excited about is the last one on Mike's list: <q>Advertising for top contributors</q>. Acquia will buy advertising on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org), and use said advertising to highlight the 10 Acquia partners that contribute to Drupal the most.

These partners will have the option to advertise their expertise and use cases on [Drupal.org industry pages](https://www.drupal.org/industries) or [Drupal.org feature pages](https://www.drupal.org/features) for the remainder of 2020. Given that [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org) sees two million unique visitors and 15 million page views per month, it should drive more awareness and new business to these valued Drupal contributors.

It's a *win-win-win-win*: the Drupal Association gets advertising revenue, Drupal's top contributors get more business, and Drupal can grow faster. All of this is obviously good for Acquia as well. It's a nice way to give back.

Promoting the companies that contribute to Drupal is always a good idea, but in an economic downturn, it's even more important. I'm proud that Acquia continues to support Drupal in a big way, and I'm excited that Acquia is experimenting with ways to promote some of Drupal's top contributors.
