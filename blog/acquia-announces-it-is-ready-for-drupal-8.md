# Acquia announces it is ready for Drupal 8

I'm excited to announce that starting today, [Acquia is announcing we're ready to fully support our customers with Drupal 8](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-launches-next-generation-digital-experience-platform-july-13). This means our professional services, our support, our product engineering, our cloud services ... the entire company is ready to help anyone with Drupal 8 starting today.

While Drupal 8 is not yet released (as it has always been said, Drupal 8 will be "ready when it's ready"), the [list of release blockers](https://www.drupal.org/8/get-involved) is dwindling ever closer to zero, and a [beta-to-beta upgrade path will soon be provided in core](https://groups.drupal.org/node/472578). These factors, along with Acquia's amazing team of more than 150 Drupal experts (including a dedicated Drupal 8 engineering team that has contributed to fixing more than 1,200 Drupal 8 issues), gives us full confidence that we can make our customers successful with Drupal 8 starting today.

In the process of working with customers on their Drupal 8 projects, we will contribute Drupal 8 core patches, port modules, help improve Drupal 8's performance and more.

I'm excited about this milestone, as [Drupal 8 will be a truly ground-breaking release](https://dri.es/why-the-big-architectural-changes-in-drupal-8). I'm most excited about the architectural enhancements that strongly position Drupal 8 for what I've called the [Big reverse of the Web](https://dri.es/the-big-reverse-of-the-web). For the web to reach its full potential, it will go through a massive re-platforming. From Flipboard to the upcoming release of Apple News, it's clear that [the web is advancing into the "post-browser" era](https://dri.es/the-post-browser-era-of-the-web-is-coming), where more and more content is "pushed" to you by smart aggregators. In this world, the traditional end-point of the browser and website become less relevant, requiring a new approach that increases the importance of structured content, metadata and advanced caching. With Drupal 8, we've built an API-driven architecture that is well suited to this new "content as a service" approach, and Drupal 8 is ahead of competitive offerings that still treat content as pages. Check out my [DrupalCon Los Angeles keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2015) for more details.
