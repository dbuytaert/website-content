I was recently interviewed by Barbara Vandenbussche for [Jobat](http://jobat.be), a Belgian employment website with a weekly print magazine written in Dutch. The [interview](https://dri.es/files/jobat08-interview.pdf) (PDF, Dutch) talks about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), but also mentions [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Mollom](https://mollom.com). It is the first time that Mollom was prominently featured in the printed press, and that needs to be celebrated with a blog post. *Yay!*
