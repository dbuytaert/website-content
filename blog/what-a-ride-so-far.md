*(The video above was shot last week when Jay and I were driving to work. Jay said 'December' but really meant 'January'.)*

As you might have read on the [Acquia website](https://www.acquia.com), Acquia is six people now. We had the fortune of being able to hire some really smart people:

- [Gábor Hojtsy](https://www.acquia.com/node/16) (Principal Acquia engineer, Drupal 6 branch maintainer),
- [Kieran Lal](https://www.acquia.com/blog/seek-strive-find-and-not-yield) (Acquia product manager, key Drupal contributor),
- [Barry Jaspan](https://www.acquia.com/bjaspan-joins-acquia) (Principal Acquia engineer, Drupal core developer), and
- [Jeff Whatcott](https://www.acquia.com/press-release-2) (Vice President of Marketing).

We're also working with an external firm that acts as a part-time Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Together, it makes for an impressive team that is gearing up rapidly.

We're currently determining what products to develop, how to build them, and who to sell them to. Soon, we'll be identifying real customers to validate our product ideas. We're also looking to [grow the team](https://www.acquia.com/jobs) so we can start developing our first products.

At the same time, we're working with the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) to advance the Drupal project: Gabor is working feverishly on the Drupal 6 release; Jay, Jeff and Kieran are part of the [DrupalCon Boston team](https://dri.es/drupalcon-boston) and myself, I'm spearheading the election of the [Drupal Association's next Board of Directors](https://dri.es/drupal-association-organization-chart-2008-wishlist), helping with the Drupal 6 release, and more.

We're only getting started, but it has already been quite a ride so far ...
