# Drupal download statistics

Last year around this time, I shared [the download statistics of Drupal core](https://dri.es/drupal-download-statistics-2006) so I figured that an update was in order. It looks like last year, from May 2006 to April 2007, Drupal core was downloaded more than 600,000 times.

These numbers do no include betas, release candidates or CVS checkouts. Also, we can't track downloads from mirrors, such as various Linux distributions, nor can we track installations through control panel software for hosting like [cPanel](http://www.cpanel.net) or [Plesk](http://www.swsoft.com/plesk/). Contributed themes or modules are not included in these numbers: we only looked at the main Drupal download.
