Remember how [I predicted that 10 Drupal books](https://dri.es/drupal-predictions-for-2008) would get published in 2008? Well, the first book showed up in the mail this morning.

Ric Shreves has written a [Drupal 5 themes book](https://www.packtpub.com/product/drupal-5-themes/9781847191823). The book is published by [Packt](http://www.packtpub.com), who mailed me a handful of copies to give away at future Drupal events.

I don't have a design background but it looks like a good book that explains the workings of the Drupal theme system and Drupal's PHPTemplate engine, that explains you how to build a theme, and that provides practical solutions to common problems during that process. If you are a hardcore developer, this book might not be for you.
