# Mother Jones using Drupal

The new [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com) launched on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.org) describes Mother Jones as an independent, non-profit magazine rooted in progressive political values and known for its investigative reporting. It has a paid circulation of 233,000 and it the most widely read progressive publication in the United States. The new site was built by [EchoDitto](https://www.echoditto.com/), a Drupal shop in Washington DC. Additional details can be found in the [Mother Jones announcement](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2009/02/introducing-new-site/).
