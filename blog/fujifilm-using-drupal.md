# Fujifilm using Drupal

The Japanese Fujifilm, with more than 75,000 employees the world's largest photographic and imaging company, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for a community site at [http://www.myfinepix.com](http://www.myfinepix.com/). It is a website where FinePix camera owners come together to share images, knowledge and inspiration. The site features galleries, forums, photoblogs, news, competitions, user profiles and much more. A good showcase for some of Drupal's social media features.
