[Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) recently turned 15. Over the past 15 years, I've heard [the name "Acquia" pronounced in all sorts of different ways](https://youtu.be/IXkgf_HYgqg).

It was Jay Batson, my co-founder, who came up with the name "Acquia". Please blame Jay for the difficult name. ;)

When it came time to pick a name for our company, Jay insisted that the name started with the letter A. I remember questioning the value of that. <q>In a world where people search for things, who looks up things in alphabetical order?</q>, I asked.

In the end, Jay was right. I learned a great many things the past 15 years, including how common alphabetical listings still are. You'd be amazed how often Acquia ranks number one in listings. It gave us a small edge.
