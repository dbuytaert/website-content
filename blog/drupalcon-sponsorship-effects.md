# DrupalCon sponsorship effects

In two weeks, 500 Drupalistas will come together in [Szeged Hungary for this year's European DrupalCon](http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/). It will be the first Drupal conference in [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe). While that is a bit of an experiment, I'm excited by it as we get to preach and listen to new and different users. What is not to like about that?

Even if you can't attend or if you are not doing business in Central Europe, you should still sponsor. Why?

There is no denying that many Open Source conferences work by a different set of rules than traditional conferences. DrupalCon is one of them. Your sponsorship makes it possible for 500 people to get together, to get aligned, to plan, and to get actual work done. It directly enables them to add to Drupal's success. Furthermore, by setting them up for success, you're indirectly enabling tens of thousands of people world-wide. Everyone, including you, will benefit from the network effects. It would be short-sighted to only think of sponsoring DrupalCon as a means to generate direct sales leads for your business, wouldn't it? You should sponsor because you want to invest in Drupal's continued international growth and success, regardless of where you have setup shop.

*Thanks to [all the DrupalCon Szeged sponsors that get this](http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/sponsors/)!*
