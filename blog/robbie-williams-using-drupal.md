A couple of weeks ago, Robbie Williams made [his comeback](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTJfNP1VEnw) on British television music talent show The X Factor, where he performed his new single "Bodies" for the first time live.

With his comeback also comes a website refresh using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org): see <http://robbiewilliams.com>. The site was developed by an Acquia partner based in the UK.
