# Acquia recognized among Inc 5000 fastest growing companies

Acquia was once again included the [Inc 5000 listing of fast-growing private U.S. companies](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2018). It's a nice milestone for us because it is the seventh year in a row that [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) has been included. We first appeared on the list in 2012, when [Acquia was ranked the eighth fastest growing private company in the United States](https://dri.es/acquia-fastest-growing-software-company-in-us). It's easy to grow fast when you get started, but as you grow, it's increasingly more challenging to sustain high growth rates. While there may be 4,700 companies ahead of us, we have kept a solid track record of growth ever since our debut seven years ago. I continue to be proud of the entire Acquia team who are relentless in making these achievements possible. *Kapow!*
