IFRA, the world's leading association for newspaper and media publishing, knows how to set an example: they are switching their websites to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org).

IFRA has 3,000 members from the newspaper industry in about 80 countries. Besides staging the newspaper industry's largest international exhibition every year, IFRA also organizes more than 100 regional exhibitions, international conferences, seminars, workshops and training events worldwide.

Their main website, <http://www.ifra.com>, is already using Drupal. The migration to Drupal is still a work in progress, but according to [Berger Schmidt](http://www.berger-schmidt.de), IFRA is switching all of its websites from Lotus Notes to Drupal this year.
