# Trends interview

André Gilain interviewed me about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) for [Trends](http://www.trends.be/), a Belgian business magazine. You can find the article in the June 15 issue of Trends Tendances (French version), or you can read it in full by clicking the link below.

This is really good publicity for Drupal, and it is exciting to see our work getting so much recognition.

I'm not sure that I like being called the "anti-Bill Gates" – it is not like I'm a modern hippy fighting windmills, am I? I wish that the article was more about Drupal and the Drupal community, and less about me. Credit should be given where credit is due: Drupal's successes should be attributed to the Drupal community, of which I am just one part.
