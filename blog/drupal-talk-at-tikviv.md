# Drupal talk at TI/KVIV

Next week, on Tuesday October 10th, I'll give an evening presentation about Drupal at the invitation of the [Royal Flemish Society of Engineers](http://www.ti.kviv.be) (TI/KVIV). The event starts at 19:30h and conveniently takes place in my home town of Antwerp. If you are a Drupal user, or interested in learning about Drupal or Open Source software development, please stop by. The event is free and open for everyone, but [registration is required](http://www.ti.kviv.be/drupal).
