I've been using my new Apple Watch 3 for several months, and recently I've been in the market for a new band. Previously, I was using a standard synthetic rubber band. I'd come home from work, and the first thing I wanted to do was take my Apple Watch off. I didn't like the clammy feel of the band, and the fit was either too loose or too tight. This week, I decided to try the new Sport Loop.

I'm currently in Chicago visiting our Acquia office, and it's pretty warm out. The Sport Loop has proven to been a great alternative. It is made out of woven nylon, it's breathable and it has a little bit of stretch. It's not going to win fashion awards, but it is comfortable enough to wear all day and I no longer feel the urge to take off my watch in the evening.
