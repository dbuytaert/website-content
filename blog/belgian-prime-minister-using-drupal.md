Today, a new Belgian government has been sworn in, ending a political deadlock of nine months. With our new government comes a new Prime Minister, and with our new Prime Minister comes a new website. It's not quite the same as the constitutional reform that was promised many months ago, but at least the Prime Minister's official website is using Drupal: <http://premier.be>.
