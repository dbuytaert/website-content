# A hosted search service for Drupal

Jay just announced [Acquia's plans to get into the hosted search business](https://www.acquia.com/blog/hosted-solr-site-search-for-drupal-is-on-the-way). By doing so, we hope to provide Drupal sites a (i) faster, (ii) more scalable search solution that (iii) can work across multiple sites, that (iv) can handle broader content, (v) that offers faceted navigation and more.

Content management systems with basic keyword search are going nowhere but out of style. Content management systems that do search really well can improve a site's navigation in new and significant ways. We want Drupal sites to be in the latter category.

As we've learned with big sites like [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org), it is extremely difficult to do search well from within Drupal, hence the need for a powerful hosted search service. By offering a hosted search service, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) continues to tear down barriers for adoption so Drupal can fulfill its full potential.

We're still working on this new service, and we don't know yet when it will be ready, but let us know if you're interested in being an early private beta tester.
