Symantec, a global leader in providing security, storage and systems management solutions, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for [Symantec Juice](http://www.symantec.com/community), a community website for customers and end-users. Check it out at <http://www.symantec.com/community>.

Interesting tidbit: by participating in site discussions, users earn points that can be redeemed for everything from gift certificates to an Hawaiian cruise.

The site was built using Drupal 6 by [WebWise](https://webwiseone.com/).
