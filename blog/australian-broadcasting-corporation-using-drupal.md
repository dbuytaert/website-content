The [Australian Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.abc.net.au) (ABC) started using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for a number of properties like [ABC Digital Music](http://abcdigmusic.net.au), [ABC Country](http://abccountry.net.au/) and [ABC Jazz](http://abcjazz.net.au/).

The ABC is Australia's national broadcaster, a public owned enterprise funded by the Australian government that has been around for 80 years.

It's really great to see the Drupal market in Australia breaking open! One day I should make it to Australia too. ;-)
