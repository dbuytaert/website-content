# IBM on hosting Drupal sites

Just when we are talking about [mass Drupal hosting](https://dri.es/mass-drupal-hosting), IBM comes up with a technical article on [hosting and deploying Drupal sites](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource12/index.html). *Coincidence?*

This is the twelfth article in IBM's series entitled [Using open source software to design, develop, and deploy a collaborative website](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html) that focuses exclusively on Drupal. If you are an aspiring Drupal developer, these articles are a must read.
