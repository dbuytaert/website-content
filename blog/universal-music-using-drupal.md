# Universal Music using Drupal

Daniel Kruchkow, Senior Vice President Global Digital Initiatives at Universal Music Group, let me know that [the Universal Music website](http://universalmusic.com), <http://universalmusic.com>, switched to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) a few months ago.

To quote Daniel: *"We're more than happy with it and are looking forward to expanding our content and feature sets as time goes on. Our users love it."*
