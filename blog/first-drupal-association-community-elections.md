# First Drupal Association community elections

When we designed a [new governance structure](https://dri.es/nominations-for-directors-of-the-drupal-association) for the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) last year, we decided that most of the board is selected through a nominating committee with the goal to carefully balance many factors like needed skills and geographical and sector representation. However, it was also deemed important that we have directors chosen directly by the Drupal community to make sure that the community is always well-represented.

I'm excited that we're holding [our first open community elections](https://www.drupal.org/association2012-elections-on). Two community "at large" directors will be elected to the [Drupal Association Board of Directors](https://www.drupal.org/associationabout/governance). If you'd like to consider running, please have a look at the ["At-large" nominations page](https://www.drupal.org/associationat-large-nominations). And if you're a Drupal community member, please make time to participate in discussions with candidates and of course to vote, starting January 26. (This process was vetted openly in the community by the Elections Committee and numerous community volunteers at <https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-association>.)

Your participation will help us take this next important step in implementing a new improved governance structure to strengthen the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org). *Thanks!*
