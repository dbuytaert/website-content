Matt Butcher's [Learning Drupal 6 module development](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Drupal-6-Module-Development/dp/1847194443) book an great introduction to begin developing on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). It is not for the die-hard developer, but it looks like a must have for new Drupal developers. *Thanks for for putting this book together, Matt!*
