# Mollom's world map of spam

Over the weekend, Ben created a [map that visualizes the website spammers in the world](https://www.mollom.com/scorecard#map) as captured by [Mollom](https://mollom.com). The map is updated multiple times a day and visualizes all the spam attempts over a time span of approximately 6 hours. Check out [Ben's blog post](https://www.mollom.com/blog/world-map-of-spam) for more details. *Interesting!*
