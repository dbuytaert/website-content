The news just keeps getting better. Today the [Associated Press](http://www.ap.org) (AP) and [NowPublic](http://nowpublic.com) announced that they have agreed to a deal that will bring NowPublic's citizen content into AP's news gathering network. According to the press release, the two companies will work together to explore ways of involving NowPublic's on-the-ground network of news contributors with AP's breaking news coverage – increasing the worlds access to news as it happens.

To put this into perspective, on any given day, more than half the world's population sees news from AP – so this is an unparalleled distribution opportunity for [citizen created content](/traditional-media-and-citizen-journalism) and contributors to NowPublic. And of course, as NowPublic is built on Drupal, it's good news for Drupal too.
