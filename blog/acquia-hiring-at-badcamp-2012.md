I love attending events like [BADCamp](http://badcamp.net). Being here gives me a chance to connect with many people I've known for a long time, but I also get to meet new people that share our passion for Drupal.

A lot of friendships are made at these events. In the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org), we have a saying: "Come for the Code, Stay for the Community". It's intriguing to see these friendships develop. Often times we end up working together; either commercially through [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), or as volunteers on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) itself. This happens for everyone, and it happens often, which is why a lot of Drupal companies use these events to try and hire people.

We're also hiring at Acquia, and [we're hiring people all around the world](https://www.acquia.com/careers). Hiring remains one of our biggest challenges at Acquia. We've seen phenomenal growth as a company, [the fastest growing software company in the US in fact](https://dri.es/acquia-fastest-growing-software-company-in-us), and are continually looking for talented Drupalists looking to make a difference in our customer's lives. Hence, we're setting up a booth at [the job fair at BADCamp](http://2012.badcamp.net/program/drupal-job-fair).

If you are interested in working on some of the most challenging Drupal projects along side some crazy talented Drupal people, stop by our booth. You can work from our headquarters in Boston, our new office in the Old Town in Portland (a great location right on the light rail), from our office in Australia or the UK. There are even opportunities to relocate cloud operations specialists to places like Australia. Or if you want, we have many positions that where you can work from anywhere in the world.

For example, our technical client advisor organization is one of the fastest growing groups within Acquia. This team is on the front lines, working on some of the most challenging Drupal problems that our customers face. But most importantly, they are making a difference in our customers lives. Whether its ensuring that Egyptian publisher Al-Masry Al-Youm's website stayed up during the country's first democratic elections or working with our partners like Palantir.net and Alfresco to help the Martin Luther King Center for Nonviolent Social Change make thousands of archived digital assets available online, our client advisors spend their days working on Drupal AND making a difference in our customers' lives. Additionally, the technical client advisor role can be the entry point to other roles within Acquia's engineering organization, including the OCTO, engineering and cloud operations teams.

There are more than 30 Drupalists from Acquia here with me at BADCamp this year. We're here to participate with the core developer summit, the UI/UX summit, the product summit and much more. If you are interested, talk to me or any of my Acquia colleagues at BADCamp and ask them what it is like working at Acquia.

And even if Acquia isn't for you, you can help us find great people. We offer [a $2,500 referral bonus](https://www.acquia.com/refer-friend-acquia-2500) to anyone who refers a friend to Acquia that gets hired. It doesn't have to be an existing Drupal developer. That bonus could pay for a ticket to DrupalCon Australia or it may help you fund some of your Drupal contributions.
