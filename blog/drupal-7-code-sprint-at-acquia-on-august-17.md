# Drupal 7 code sprint at Acquia on August 17

On Tuesday August 17, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) is sponsoring a day-long code sprint at our offices just outside of Boston. During the sprint, we'll concentrate on addressing as many of the core Drupal 7 critical issues as possible.

[Moshe Weitzman](http://cyrve.com/) and [Stéphane Corlosquet (scor)](http://openspring.net/) have already signed up along with various Acquians including [Barry Jaspan](http://jaspan.com/), [David Rothstein](http://twomice.org/), [Peter Wolanin](https://www.drupal.org/user/49851), [Alex Bronstein](https://www.drupal.org/user/78040) (effulgentsia) and [Gábor Hojtsy](http://hojtsy.hu/). I will be reviewing, testing, and committing patches throughout the day.

If you're in the Boston area (or can get there) and you know how to fix bugs, write tests, and submit patches, you are more than welcome to join us. Acquia's exact address (along with a Google Map) is available at the bottom of the [Acquia contact page](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/contact). Space is limited, so please leave a comment if you plan to attend. This way we can plan accordingly and start coordinating the sprint ahead of time.

I hope to see many of you there, including plenty of new faces.
