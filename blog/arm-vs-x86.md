# ARM vs x86

Yesterday Mozilla released [Firefox 84](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/84.0/releasenotes/) with native support for Apple's new [M1 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M1). The result? Firefox launches over 2.5 times faster and web applications are twice as responsive. Impressive!

These performance improvements are the result of Apple's M1 being an [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture)-based processor, rather than the traditional [x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86)-based processors sold by Intel and AMD.

One of my first jobs out of college was to write a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for both the ARM and x86 architecture. I experienced first-hand how much more elegant the ARM architecture is. Twenty years later, ARM continues to impress me.

In a different corner of the technology world, Amazon is working on the 3rd generation of its [Graviton chip](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/). Graviton processors are custom built by and for Amazon Web Services, and also use an ARM-based core. The Graviton 3 is likely to offer an extreme performance/price benefit compared to any x86 alternative. The Graviton 2 is already 20% faster than x86 instances, so it wouldn't surprise me if the Graviton 3 is 40-80% faster. For many, that justifies the switching cost.

ARM started outclassing the x86 on the desktop *and* in the server room. End users are starting to notice. None of this bodes well for Intel or AMD. While the x86 still dominates the market, I just don't see how Intel can stop this trend. A few weeks ago, I sold all my Intel stock. Only time will tell if that was the right call, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.
