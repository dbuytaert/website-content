Google announced [Measurement Lab](http://www.measurementlab.net) (M-Lab) this week, an open platform that researchers can use to deploy internet measurement tools. M-Lab will give end users the tools to figure out whether internet service providers are interfering with their broadband connections by blocking or throttling certain applications. Turns out that the current M-Lab site is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). *Cool!*
