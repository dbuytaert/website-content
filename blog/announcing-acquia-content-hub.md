The explosion of content continues to grow. With more and more organizations [managing multiple sites](https://dri.es/how-acquia-is-addressing-the-explosion-of-sites) and digital channels, the distribution of content is increasingly difficult to manage. Content can easily become siloed in different sites or platforms. Different data models make it challenging to access, update, and replicate content changes across your sites.

Today, we're excited to announce [Acquia Content Hub](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift), a cloud-based content distribution and discovery service. Content Hub serves as a central content repository or *hub* that allows for bidirectional distribution of content between different platforms. Content Hub lets authors and site owners reuse content from other sites, commerce platforms, and more. To facilitate sharing between all these different systems, we normalize the content, and provide centralized tools to search and discover content within your network of sites. In addition, Content Hub can automatically keep content consistent across different sites (publish-subscribe), mitigating the risk of out of date information, all while respecting workflow rules on the local destination site.

I'm excited about the launch of Content Hub because I believe it will become a critical building block for creating digital experiences that are smart, personal, contextual, predictive, and continuous across digital touch-points in our lives (see [Big Reverse of the Web](https://dri.es/the-big-reverse-of-the-web)). It's an ambitious vision that will require organizations to better leverage all of their content and data. This means that eventually all data has to get linked: from textual, audio and video data, to customer information and customer support data, to sensory and contextual customer information. To process that amount of data, we will have to build smart systems on top of it to create better digital experiences for the customer. Last year [we launched Acquia Lift](https://dri.es/announcing-acquia-lift), and now 12 months later we're launching Content Hub – both are important steps towards that vision.
