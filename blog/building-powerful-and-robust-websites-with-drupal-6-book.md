[Building powerful and robust websites with Drupal 6](https://www.amazon.com/Building-powerful-robust-websites-Drupal/dp/1847192971) is an update to David Mercer's two year old book [Drupal: Creating Blogs, Forums, Portals and Community Websites](https://dri.es/packt-drupal-book).

Just like David's previous book, this book is geared towards people who are new to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and that have little or no experience in website design, PHP, MySQL or HTML. If you want practical advice on how to get a Drupal site up and running, this book is for you. Unlike David's first Drupal book, this book also caters to the intermediate Drupal user as it talks about Drupal's content construction kit, actions, triggers and even jQuery. Reading this book won't make you a Drupal expert, but it will give you a solid base from which to build.
