Google just announced that they will sponsor [18 Drupal developer stipends](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2010/drupal) in this year's [Summer of Code program](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/?csw=1) (SoC). Google provides a stipend of 5,000 USD to each student developer, of which 4,500 USD goes to the student and 500 USD goes to [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) (or to the mentors). With 18 accepted applications this adds up to a 90,000 USD investment over a three-month period, bringing the total investment made by Google in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) through SoC to over $450,000 USD.

The accepted students, their projects, and the mentors are listed on [the official Drupal.org announcement](https://www.drupal.org/node/782294). Congratulations to all successful applicants, and thanks to the Drupal Summer of Code organizers, the Drupal mentors, and last but not least, Google. *The summer is of to a great start!*
