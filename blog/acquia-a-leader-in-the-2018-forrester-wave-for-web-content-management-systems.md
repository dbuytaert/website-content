# Acquia a leader in the 2018 Forrester Wave for Web Content Management Systems

This week [Acquia was named a leader in the Forrester Wave: Web Content Management Systems](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-named-leader-web-content-management-systems). Acquia was previously named a leader in WCM systems in [Q1 2017](https://dri.es/acquia-a-leader-in-the-2017-forrester-wave-for-web-content-management-systems).

The report highlights [Acquia and Drupal's leadership on decoupled and headless architectures](https://dri.es/tag/headless-drupal), in addition to [Acquia Cloud's support for Node.js](https://dri.es/announcing-node-js-on-acquia-cloud).

I'm especially proud of the fact that Acquia received the highest strategy score among all vendors.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this result! It's another great milestone for [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
