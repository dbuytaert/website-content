# French Ministry for Health, Youth and Sport using Drupal

The French Ministry for Health, Youth and Sport launched a Drupal-based information portal for French youth: <http://www.jeunes.gouv.fr>. Building on the rapid adoption of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) by non-profit and advocacy groups, Drupal's use by governments just keeps increasing!
