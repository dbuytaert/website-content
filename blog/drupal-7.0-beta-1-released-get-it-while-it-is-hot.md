# Drupal 7.0 beta 1 released: get it while it's hot

Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, after more than 2.5 years of non-stop work, we have released the [first beta of Drupal 7.0](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.0-beta1).

Drupal 7 is a nicer looking, more powerful, and more scalable Drupal. Plus, it's easier to use than previous versions. It's quite [a metamorphosis for designers, developers, and administrators](https://dri.es/drupal-7-the-cocoon-and-the-butterfly). So, [check it out](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.0-beta1) and let us know what you think. While you're at it, you can help us find and fix any remaining bugs.

This also means that we're in the last stages, preparing for the final Drupal 7.0 release. I feel like a kid on Christmas eve. I can hardly wait to unwrap the beta package so [let's get it done](https://dri.es/drupal-7-lets-get-it-done)!
