# Seb Van Stichel

[image miscellaneous-2015/seb-van-stichel-1]

Today the world welcomed a healthy baby boy: Seb Van Stichel. Congratulations to my sister, Mien, and my brother-in-law, Johan. My Opa, the oldest member of our family at 94 years old, is holding his great-grandson, the youngest member of the family. I'm honored to be Seb's godfather; my Christmas budget will be going up. :-)
