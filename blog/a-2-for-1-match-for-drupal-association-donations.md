# A 2-for-1 match for Drupal Association donations

[image drupal/blue-hearts-3]

Last week, Vanesssa and I pledged to [match $100,000 in individual contributions to the Drupal Association](https://dri.es/pledging-100000-usd-to-support-the-drupal-association).

Then today, [29 organizations in the Drupal community pledged *another* $100,000](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupalcares-thanks-to-drupal-businesses-you-can-now-triple-your-impact) to match Vanessa's and my pledge!

For every $1 you donate, the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) now gets $3. ?

So far 700 people have contributed roughly $72,000 to [\#DrupalCares](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupalcares-sustaining-the-da-through-the-covid-19-crisis). Because both matching gifts apply to all individual donations or memberships from the start of the campaign, we're up to $216,000 (3 x $72,000).

It's been heartwarming to see that so many have stepped up to provide support.

The various creative responses have also been amazing. One of my favorite examples is Gábor Hojtsy's: [Gábor will donate €9 for every Drupal module that gets updated to Drupal 9](http://hojtsy.hu/drupalcares-9). Best of all, his €9 donation will also be matched 2-for-1. For every module that gets updated in the next two weeks, €27 could get fundraised for the Drupal Association. Since Gábor announced his challenge 5 days ago, 65 modules have been updated already. It raises money for the Drupal Association *and* it helps the Drupal community prepare for [the Drupal 9 release later this year](https://dri.es/plan-for-drupal-9). Such a clever idea and what a difference it can make!

Thank you again to all of the individuals and organizations who have graciously donated to the Drupal Association so far. Every contribution matters and means so much! We hope those of you reading this will [join us in donating](https://www.drupal.org/association/sustain-da-covid-19) or launching creative campaigns.
