On April 25th, [CMS Channel](http://www.cms-channel.be) organizes [WebTech 2007](http://www.cms-channel.be/index.php?id=412) in Affligem, Belgium. The conference is about new trends in web technologies and offers a mixture of lectures, workshops and an exhibition hall.

Not sure what the conference will be like, but let's check it out.

The registration fee is € 199 per person, but I have some free registrations to give away. Let me know if you want to join me, and I might be able to get you in for free.
