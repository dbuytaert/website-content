Someone recorded the *State of Drupal* presentation I gave at the [Open Source CMS Summit at Yahoo!](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo) last month. I'm not the world's best speaker, but the talk does touch upon a number of points that I want the people in the Drupal community to take note of. As not all Drupal contributors were able to attend the conference, I'm reposting the video on my blog.

*(The video was originally uploaded to video.google.com but is no longer available. If you have a copy, please [let me know](https://dri.es/about#4)!)*
