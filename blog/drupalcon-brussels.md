Good news! The next Drupal conference (DrupalCon) will take place on September 22nd to 23rd in Brussels (Belgium), alongside [Euro OSCON 2006](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/), [GovCamp 2006](http://www.govcamp.org/) and [BarCamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels). We setup a conference website at <https://events.drupal.org/>.

Now the dates are set and the venue is confirmed, we're [ready to accept presentation proposals and registrations](https://www.drupal.org/node/77404) (and looking for additional sponsors).

Whether you are a Drupal professional or an enthusiastic user coming to find out more, we encourage you to join us in Brussels, and to rock out with the smartest Drupal developers, the best Drupal evangelists and top-notch Drupal consultants.

If you want to capture and absorb the passion and enthusiasm behind the Drupal project, this is the place to be. Ideas will fly back and forth. Knowledge will be shared. The Drupal Kool-Aid will be passed around, and the secret Drupal handshake will be taught.
