# Second Drupal Association community elections

Earlier this year, I posted about [our first Drupal Association community elections](http://https://dri.es/first-drupal-association-community-elections). We introduced the *community elections* with the goal to make sure that the Drupal community is always well-represented on the [Drupal Association's Board of Directors](https://www.drupal.org/associationabout/governance).

Well, the time has come to run our elections again. Nominations opened on 1 September and were open for two weeks. 18 people from the Drupal community put themselves forward as candidates. Please have a look at the [election candidates](https://www.drupal.org/associationnominations). Voting will be open from September 24 to October 7 but now is the time to engage with the candidates.

### Who can vote?

You are eligible to vote if you have an account on drupal.org, logged in during the past 12 months, and created your account before August 31 this year when the election was announced. Once voting opens, you can login at <https://association.drupal.org> and rank the candidates in order of preference.

### How does voting work?

Voting uses the ['instant runoff'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting) method powered by [Drupal's own decisions module](https://www.drupal.org/project/decisions). For more information about this method of voting, [watch this helpful YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wA3_t-08Vr0) which explains it with post-it notes!
