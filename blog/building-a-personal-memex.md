# Building a personal memex

[Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/) is one of the most prolific bloggers in the world, capable of publishing multiple great posts a day. He recently [documented his writing and publishing process](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd). It's fascinating.

Over the last 20 years, Cory built a huge, personal database of thoughts, articles and links. He explains [how his database simplifies and supports his writing process](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd):

> The memex I've created by thinking about and then describing every interesting thing I've encountered is hugely important for how I understand the world. It's the raw material of every novel, article, story and speech I write.

Inspired by Cory, I want to build my own [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex) with the goal to become a better writer.
