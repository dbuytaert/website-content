# Making waves in Gijón

[image miscellaneous-2008/waves-in-gijon]

I'm here in [Gijón](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n) (Spain) to present at the [W3C's Web Fundamentals conference](http://www.fundamentosweb.org). I went for a walk last night to ponder about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), [web standards](http://w3c.org), the semantic web, and what to talk about in my session today. Good thing I carried my camera because it is stunning out here.
