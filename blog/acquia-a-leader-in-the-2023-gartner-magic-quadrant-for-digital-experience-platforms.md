# Acquia a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms

[image acquia/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-digital-experience-platforms-2023 resize=false schema=false]

For the fourth consecutive year, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) has been named a *Leader* in the [Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms (DXP)](https://www.acquia.com/resources/report/gartner-dxp-magic-quadrant).

Market recognition from [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/) on our product vision is exciting, because it aligns with what customers and partners are looking for in an open, composable DXP.

Acquia's strengths lie in its ties to [Drupal](https://drupal.org/), our open architecture, and its ability to take advantage of APIs to integrate with third-party applications.

Last year, I covered in detail what it means to be a [Composable DXP](https://dri.es/a-composable-digital-experience-manifesto).
