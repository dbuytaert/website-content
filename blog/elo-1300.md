Today, at the peak of the [biggest chess drama in years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnTLeaALCRc), I silently reached Elo 1300 on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/).

[Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) is the rating system used in chess, and Elo 1300 means I'm a "decent social player".

I shared this news with my family, and got something between a blank stare and an eye roll. I don't blame them.

If you think chess is boring, I encourage you to take a look at [game 6 of the 2021 World Chess Championship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmQs1KhB948).

I'll let you know when I get to Elo 1400. Being busy and all, that will likely take me several months.
