[Le Figaro](http://www.lefigaro.fr), the oldest and second-largest national newspaper in France, started using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for its social features on <http://www.lefigaro.fr>. It is still using its old web content management system to serve its main content, but all of the social features such as comments on articles are now provided by Drupal.

I met the engineering team, including Le Figaro's Chief Technology Officer René Wallendorf, for lunch when I was in Paris last week, and they were very happy with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). The integration project was delivered on time, within budget and was considerably cheaper than the alternative solutions they had investigated. All things combined, this should be a big win for Drupal, especially in France. *Vraiment très cool!*
