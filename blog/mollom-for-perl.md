# Mollom for Perl

Michael Peters has just released version 0.03 of his Mollom plugin for Perl. The software is available at [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~wonko/Net-Mollom-0.03/) or through your CPAN installer via "install Net::Mollom". I haven't reviewed the code yet, but if you try it and have comments, be sure to post them here. *Woop, woop!*
