A day or so ago, [Mollom](https://mollom.com) blocked its fifty-millionth spam attempt, reaching another milestone in a list that is expanding with increasing frequency. After all, it was only a little over two months ago ([on January 28th](https://dri.es/more-milestones-for-mollom)) that we reached twenty-five million, about six months ago ([on October 6th](https://dri.es/ten-million-spam-attempts-blocked)) that we reached ten million, and about a year ago ([on March 31, 2008](https://dri.es/mollom-my-content-monitoring-startup)) that [Benjamin](http://about.me/benjamin_schrauwen) and I began Mollom.

According to [our scorecard](https://www.mollom.com/scorecard), we're currently protecting over 7,000 websites from comment spam, with an average efficiency of 99.95%. Only 5 in every 10,000 spam messages slip past our filters, and even that small number continues to fall as Mollom's accuracy improves. Around 85% of all the messages processed by Mollom are spam.

Even though we're still a small company by all standards, we're proud of what we've done to help stem the spread of comment spam. The [Mollom download page](https://www.mollom.com/download) features plugins for five different CMS's (including Drupal, Joomla!, WordPress, Radiant, and SilverStripe), and seven different developer libraries (including Java, PHP5, Ruby, Python, ColdFusion, .NET, and the Zend Framework). Our [pricing page](https://www.mollom.com/pricing) describes our current product offerings, and our exciting new [Software Partners page](https://www.mollom.com/partners) describes a few special partnerships we've formed to help supercharge your Mollom experience.

Fifty million is a big number, but we're just getting started. More to come!
