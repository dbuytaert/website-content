# White House contributes to Drupal

Very exciting news from the White House today.

Last night President Obama fulfilled his promise to release the code behind ["We the People"](https://www.whitehouse.gov/petitions), a Drupal-based application that enables the American people to directly petition the President of the United States on issues they care most about. The release follows a commitment the President made to the United Nations to share the technology behind this platform "so any government in the world can enable its citizens to do the same".

White House Director of Digital Strategy Macon Phillips explains the move in [a White House blog post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/08/23/open-sourcing-we-the-people) featured today on the front page of [whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov).

In October of 2009, [WhiteHouse.gov was relaunched on Drupal](https://dri.es/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal). Two years later, the White House launched [We the People](https://www.whitehouse.gov/petitions) on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), a big step forward for Open Government. While governments haven't traditionally recognized the importance of the grassroots, word of mouth organizing that thrives on the Internet, [We the People](https://www.whitehouse.gov/petitions) encourages grassroots citizen engagement.

Even more exciting is that if you are an Open Source developer, you can get involved with improving how your government actually works. Needless to say, I'm thrilled to see Open Source and Drupal changing the world in a positive, powerful way.

The newly released code is packaged as a [Drupal install profile](https://dri.es/drupal-distributions). The profile is currently tailored to the White House's website but every Github member can issue pull requests to make it more generally useful. The [Petition install profile](https://github.com/whitehouse/petition) can be cloned, forked or downloaded from the [White House's Github repository](https://github.com/WhiteHouse).
