# Future of Open Source Survey 2010

Like last year, I'll be attending the Open Source Business Conference (OSBC) next month, on March 17-18 in San Francisco. Also like last year, I will participate in a [panel discussion](https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=7578&tabid=3659&discountcode=osbcmain) led by [Michael Skok](http://nbvp.northbridge.com/OurTeam/Bio.asp?PartnerID=9) (Partner at North Bridge, Acquia Board Member and personal friend). This year, I'll be in a panel with Larry Augustin (CEO of SugarCRM, VA Linux, SourceForge), Jim Whitehurst (CEO of RedHat) and Tim Yeaton (CEO of Black Duck Software) to discuss the future of Open Source businesses. The panel discussion will draw on the "2010 Future of Open Source survey" so make sure to weigh in and provide your perspective on a number of important Open Source business questions. As a reference, here are the [2009 and 2008 results](http://futureofopensource.drupalgardens.com/survey).
