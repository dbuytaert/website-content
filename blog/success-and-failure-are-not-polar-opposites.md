# Failure often paves the way for success

Success and failure are not polar opposites: you often need to endure failure to enjoy success. In [Google's 2004 Founders' IPO Letter](https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2004-ipo-letter/), Larry Page wrote:

> We will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because of short term earnings pressure. Some of our past bets have gone extraordinarily well, and others have not. Because we recognize the pursuit of such projects as the key to our long term success, we will continue to seek them out. For example, we would fund projects that have a 10% chance of earning a billion dollars over the long term. Do not be surprised if we place smaller bets in areas that seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses. Although we cannot quantify the specific level of risk we will undertake, as the ratio of reward to risk increases, we will accept projects further outside our current businesses, especially when the initial investment is small relative to the level of investment in our current businesses.

Think big and fail well – fail fast, fail often, and learn from your mistakes.
