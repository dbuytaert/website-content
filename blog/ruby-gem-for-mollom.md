[Jan De Poorter](http://blog.defv.be/) of [Openminds](http://openminds.be) (my favorite hosting company), wrote [a Ruby Gem for Mollom](https://www.openminds.be/article/mollom-ruby-gem). You can get the Gem from <http://mollom.rubyforge.org/>. Jan told me that a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) plugin is on its way, so keep an eye on [Jan's development blog](http://workswithruby.com/). *Thanks Jan!*
