We just celebrated our two year anniversary of [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com)'s expansion into the European market. It has been a phenomenal two years and as a result, we have grown to over 50 employees in Europe. Our UK office is bursting at the seams so we're about to move into our new digs in Reading. We also have a growing presence in the Benelux, France and Germany.

We are looking for more great talent, no matter what level you're at. If you are passionate about working on some of the most challenging Drupal projects alongside other talented Drupalists, we want to talk to you! Please stop by Acquia's booth at [DrupalCamp London](http://drupalcamplondon.co.uk), or contact us at <careers@acquia.com>.
