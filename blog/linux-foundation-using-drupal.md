# Linux Foundation using Drupal

In 1996, Linux kernel development is what first attracted me to Open Source, and what led me to contribute to the Linux WLAN project in 1999. Ever since, I've worked on or with Open Source projects pretty much full-time.

Last month at the [Open Source Business Conference](https://dri.es/osbc-wrapup-2009) in San Francisco, I met Mike Woster, Director of Business Development at the [Linux Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org), the non-profit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux. Turns out they are avid users of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org).

In 2008, they switched the [Linux Developer Network](http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/) to Drupal, earlier this year they launched a [video site](http://video.linuxfoundation.org/) on Drupal, and most recently, [LinuxFoundation.org](http://linuxfoundation.org) itself switched to Drupal! And rumor has it [there might be more to come](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/weblogs/press/2009/03/03/linux-foundation-to-build-new-linuxcom-community/) ...
