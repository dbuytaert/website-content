Vanessa and I have been talking about how we can help contribute to the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association), and by extension the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/), in [these uncertain times](https://dri.es/sustaining-the-drupal-association-in-uncertain-times). We want to show our support given [Drupal's positive impact](https://dri.es/drupal-collective-purpose) on our lives.

We have decided to donate a minimum of $44,000 to match [all 485 individual donations so far](https://www.drupal.org/association/donate). We will also continue to match new donations up to $100,000.

In order for your donation to be matched, it needs to be an *individual donation* or an *individual memberships*, not an *organizational contribution*, and it needs to be donated by April 30, 2020.

Together, we can provide $200,000 to [\#DrupalCares](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupalcares-sustaining-the-da-through-the-covid-19-crisis). Our total fundraising goal is $500,000 so $200,000 coming from individuals would be an incredible start, and will help us raise the remaining $300,000.

We hope you [join us in donating](https://www.drupal.org/association/sustain-da-covid-19).

Be kind to others and help where you can! ?
