# DrupalCon Boston registration open

The [DrupalCon Boston 2008](https://dri.es/drupalcon-boston) registration is now open! You can register at [http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org).

$195 USD for four days of tremendous fun, to (re-)connect with other Drupal users and developers, to share information and to learn from the best Drupal developers and Drupal companies in the world. Heck, lunches and coffee are included in the price. All run by Drupalistas, for Drupalistas so it doesn't get much better than that. And in case there is a surplus from the fees and sponsors, the [Drupal Association](http://assocation.drupal.org) will use that money to gear up its activities in 2008.

[Sign up now](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org), because you always win! ;-)
