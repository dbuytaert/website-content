Last week in Prague, I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation. A total of [1,830 Drupalists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tHvys7xTRM) were present at DrupalCon, a new record for our European DrupalCon!

In good tradition, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2013.pdf) (PDF, 31 MB) or you can [watch a video recording of my keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uhNFoOnz_g). The keynote starts at 11:42, but don't miss out on the [singing carrots introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOoDCdeFYQ4). A video recording of the keynote is embedded in this post.
