# Rock Band using Drupal

The website of [Rock Band](http://rockband.com), a music video game for the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3 is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). The game was developed by Harmonix Music Systems, published by MTV Games, and distributed by Electronic Arts Partners, but who built the website?
