# White House releases source code for IT Dashboard

[Vivek Kundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Kundra) just released the Drupal software code for the [ITDashboard.gov](http://itdashboard.gov) tool, which is built on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) by [REI Systems](http://www.reisys.com). You can find the source code at <https://www.cio.gov/tools/>. More information can be found in a blog post by [Alex Howards](https://twitter.com/digiphile) from [O'Reilly Radar](http://radar.oreilly.com): [White House releases IT Dashboard as open source code](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/03/white-house-it-dashboard-open-source.html).

This is important for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and Open Source: the U.S. Government, one of the largest IT buyers and users in the world, has just taken another big step in embracing Open Source and becoming an active contributor. It also enables us, the Open Source community, to help the U.S. Government enhance [ITDashboard.gov](http://itdashboard.gov) or to recommend it to our respective governments all around the world. *Very cool!*
