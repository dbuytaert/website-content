While I love photography, I never really got into video. Because I'm not the guy to pull off flips on skis or jump out of planes, I never considered myself the target audience for a [GoPro](http://gopro.com). However, [I got a GoPro for Christmas](https://dri.es/album/christmas-2014/christmas-19) and was eager to try it on a ski trip to the French Alps. Below is my first attempt at shooting and editing video. The French Alps are stunning and that alone is reason to watch the video. No doubt I have to hone my skills – both shooting and in the editing room – and it wouldn't hurt if I could pull off a flip on my skis either. ;-)
