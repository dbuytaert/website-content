Two weeks ago, at DrupalCon Chicago, I gave my traditional *State of Drupal* presentation. In good tradition, you can download a copy of [my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-march-2011.pdf) (PDF, 52 MB) or you can watch [a video recording](https://archive.org/details/keynote_dries) of my keynote on archive.org.

Just before DrupalCon, [m62.net](http://m62.net), a presentation development company, offered to help me with the production of my slides. I took them up on their offer. They helped me put together the video and helped me with the visuals, as well as the delivery. They went above and beyond to help me – all free of charge. I think the slides were very effective in delivering the message so a big "Thank you!" to m62.
