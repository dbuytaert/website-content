# Belgian Drupal User Group

One of the things I'd like to figure out at [DrupalCon Brussels](/drupalcon-brussels), is whether there is enough momentum for a *Belgian Drupal User Group*. (A group of people that organizes monthly meetings to network and host presentations for Drupal users.) It sounds like a great way to build and maintain a network of local Drupal users, contributors and companies providing Drupal-related services. It is not something I might be able to take a lead in, but it is certainly something I'd be happy to help with.
