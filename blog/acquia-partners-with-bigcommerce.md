# Acquia partners with BigCommerce

Today, Acquia [announced a partnership with BigCommerce](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-bigcommerce-partner-accelerate-content-commerce-initiatives), a leading cloud commerce platform. BigCommerce recently launched a headless commerce solution called [BigCommerce Commerce-as-a-Service](https://www.bigcommerce.com/commerce-as-a-service/) to complement its "traditional" commerce solutions. Acquia's partnership with BigCommerce will center around this Commerce-as-a-Service solution to enable customers to take advantage of [headless commerce architectures](https://dri.es/the-rise-of-headless-commerce), while leveraging Drupal and Acquia to power [content-rich shopping experiences](https://dri.es/content-and-commerce-a-big-opportunity-for-drupal).

With [BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/), brands can use a commerce-as-a-service approach to quickly build an online store and oversee product management and transactional data. The front-end of the commerce experience will be powered by [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), built and managed using the Acquia Platform, and personalized with [Acquia Lift](https://dri.es/tag/acquia-lift).

This month, Acquia has been focused on expanding our partnerships with headless commerce vendors. This announcement comes on the heels of [our partnership with Elastic Path](https://dri.es/the-rise-of-headless-commerce). Our partnership with BigCommerce not only reinforces our belief in headless commerce, but also [our commitment to a best-of-breed commerce strategy](https://dri.es/the-rise-of-headless-commerce) that puts the needs of our customers first.
