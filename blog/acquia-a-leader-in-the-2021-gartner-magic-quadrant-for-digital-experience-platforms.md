# Acquia a Leader in the 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms

For the second year, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) was named a Leader in [Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms](https://www.acquia.com/resources/report/gartner-dxp-magic-quadrant) (DXPs).

Our leadership position improved compared to last year. Acquia is now the clear number two behind Adobe. Market validation from Gartner on our vision is exciting and encouraging.

In the report, the analysts note the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/) as a powerful entity that sets Acquia apart from closed-monoliths. Closed monolithic stacks and martech silos are quickly becoming a thing of the past. Drupal's scale, modularity and openness is a real differentiator.
