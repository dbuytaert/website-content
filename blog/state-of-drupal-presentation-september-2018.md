Last week, nearly 1,000 Drupalists gathered in Darmstadt, Germany for Drupal Europe. In good tradition, I presented [my State of Drupal keynote](https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal). You can [watch a recording of my keynote](https://youtu.be/iXB0sNreSlM?t=4m38s) (starting at 4:38) or [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2018.pdf) (37 MB).

### Drupal 8 continues to mature

I started my keynote by highlighting this month's [Drupal 8.6.0 release](https://dri.es/drupal-8-6-0-released). Drupal 8.6 marks the sixth consecutive Drupal 8 release that has been delivered on time. Compared to one year ago, we have 46 percent more stable Drupal 8 modules. We also have 10 percent more contributors are working on Drupal 8 Core in comparison to last year. All of these milestones indicate that the Drupal 8 is healthy and growing.

Next, I gave an update on our strategic initiatives:

### Make Drupal better for content creators

[image drupal-europe-darmstadt-2018/drupal-europe-2]

The expectations of content creators are changing. For Drupal to be successful, we have to continue to deliver on their needs by providing more powerful content management tools, in addition to delivering simplicity though drag-and-drop functionality, WYSIWYG, and more.

With the release of Drupal 8.6, we have added new functionality for content creators by making improvements to the Media, Workflow, Layout and Out-of-the-Box initiatives. I showed a demo video to demonstrate how all of these new features not only make content authoring easier, but more powerful:

We also need to improve the content authoring experience through a modern administration user interface. We have been working on [a new administration UI using React](https://dri.es/drupal-looking-to-adopt-react). I showed a video of our latest prototype:

### Extended security coverage for Drupal 8 minor releases

I announced an update to Drupal 8's security policy. To date, site owners had one month after a new minor Drupal 8 release to upgrade their sites before losing their security updates. Going forward, Drupal 8 site owners have 6 months to upgrade between minor releases. This extra time should give site owners flexibility to plan, prepare and test minor security updates. For more information, [check out my recent blog post](https://dri.es/extended-security-coverage-for-drupal-8-minor-releases).

### Make Drupal better for evaluators

One of the most significant updates since [DrupalCon Nashville](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2018) is Drupal's improved evaluator experience. The time required to get a Drupal site up and running has decreased from [more than 15 minutes](https://dri.es/three-ways-we-can-improve-drupal-evaluator-experience) to less than two minutes and from 20 clicks to 3. This is a big accomplishment. You can read more about it [in my recent blog post](https://dri.es/we-made-drupal-a-lot-easier-to-evaluate).

### Promote Drupal

After launching [Promote Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/promotedrupal) at [DrupalCon Nashville](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2018), we hit the ground running with this initiative and successfully published a community press release for the release of Drupal 8.6, which was also translated into multiple languages. Much more is underway, including building a brand book, marketing collaboration space on Drupal.org, and a Drupal pitch deck.

### The Drupal 9 roadmap and a plan to end-of-life Drupal 7 and Drupal 8

To keep Drupal modern, maintainable, and performant, we need to stay on secure, supported versions of Drupal 8's third-party dependencies. This means we need to end-of-life Drupal 8 with Symfony 3's end-of-life. As a result, I announced that:

1. Drupal 8 will be end-of-life by November 2021.
2. Drupal 9 will be released in 2020, and [it will be an easy upgrade](https://dri.es/making-drupal-upgrades-easy-forever).

Historically, our policy has been to only support two major versions of Drupal; Drupal 7 would ordinarily reach end of life when Drupal 9 is released. Because a large number of sites might still be using Drupal 7 by 2020, we have decided to extend support of Drupal 7 until November 2021.

For those interested, I published [a blog post that further explains this](https://dri.es/drupal-7-8-and-9).

### Adopt GitLab on Drupal.org

Finally, the Drupal Association is working to [integrate GitLab with Drupal.org](https://about.gitlab.com/2018/08/16/drupal-moves-to-gitlab/). GitLab will provide support for "merge requests", which means contributing to Drupal will feel more familiar to the broader audience of open source contributors who learned their skills in the post-patch era. Some of GitLab's tools, such as inline editing and web-based code review, will also lower the barrier to contribution, and should help us grow both [the number of contributions and contributors on Drupal.org](https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2018).

To see an exciting preview of Drupal.org's gitlab integration, watch the video below:

### Thank you

Our community has a lot to be proud of, and this progress is the result of thousands of people collaborating and working together. It's pretty amazing! The power of our community isn't just visible in minor releases or a number of stable modules. It was also felt at this very conference, as many volunteers gave their weekends and evenings to help organize Drupal Europe in the absence of a DrupalCon Europe organized by the Drupal Association. From code to community, the Drupal project is making an incredible impact. I look forward to celebrating our community's work and friendships at future Drupal conferences.
