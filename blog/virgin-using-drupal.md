# Virgin using Drupal

Virgin Radio is using Drupal for a number of websites. Example: <http://www.virginradio999.com>.

I'm excited by this because I'm a [Richard Branson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson) fan. There, I have said it. He is one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time. He proves that you can do well, do good, and have a great time doing it – which is exactly how I like to run [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Mollom](https://mollom.com). I you haven't read [his book](https://www.amazon.com/Losing-My-Virginity-Survived-Business/dp/0812932293) yet, you should!
