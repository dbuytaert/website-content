As you might have noticed, buytaert.net got redesigned. The previous incarnation was getting a little old and the header was seriously out of date now that I left the university and co-founded [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Mollom](https://mollom.com). Thankfully, [Michael Angeles](http://urlgreyhot.com/) of [urlgreyhot](http://urlgreyhot.com/) created a new theme for my Drupal site. Michael is a world-class information architect, user experience design consultant and long time Drupal contributor. *Thanks Michael!*

First reaction?
