If you are a Drupal developer, try to imagine for one moment how many times your Drupal code has been executed. Thousands of websites use Drupal, some of which serve millions of pages a month. Millions upon millions of page views. Our code gets parsed and executed over and over again. When you sleep, when you eat, when you commute to work or when you blink your eyes. Every second, for years to come, all around the world, billions of times. It is the most fascinating thought.
