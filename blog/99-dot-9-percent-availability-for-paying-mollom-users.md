# 99.9% availability for paying Mollom users

At [Mollom](https://mollom.com), we're focused on blocking spam. To do that, we've built a world-class (and world-wide) infrastructure that evaluates your site's comments and posts in real time, freeing you from moderation duties to spend your time on more satisfying pursuits.

Mollom is built on the [freemium business model](https://dri.es/the-freemium-business-model-giving-away-pays), and our customers have a variety of different needs. While many of our clients take advantage of our free filtering service to protect their site, a growing number use our Mollom Plus subscription service. We're always looking for new ways to add value for all of our customers, especially those with Mollom Plus subscriptions.

To that end, we're pleased to announce our new 99.9% availability standard for the back-end network available to our Mollom Plus subscribers. With 99.9% availability, we guarantee to keep our infrastructure working on your behalf. Those guarantees are in writing at <https://www.mollom.com/standard-service-level-agreement> and part of the [updated web service agreement for paid subscriptions](https://www.mollom.com/service-agreement-paid-subscriptions).

For around [1 euro a day](https://www.mollom.com/pricing), the Mollom Plus subscription service provides great value. At 99.9% availability, it provides great reliability. And by accurately blocking spam, it provides peace of mind.
