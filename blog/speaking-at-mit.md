# Speaking at MIT

I will be speaking at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) on Monday, October 26 at 5pm in the [Stata Center in Cambridge](http://whereis.mit.edu/?selection=32&Buildings=go). I plan to talk about the state of Drupal, Drupal 7 and Open Source development in general. After the presentation, there will be some time for social networking. The event is free so you're all invited to attend!

On a somewhat related note, we have some intern positions open at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) to give people the opportunity to come and learn about Drupal – students from MIT, Harvard or other universities interested in an internship at Acquia should certainly attend and approach me about it.
