I just updated my site to [Drupal 8.5](https://dri.es/drupal-8-5-0-released) and spent some time reading the [Drupal 8.5 release notes](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.5.0). Seeing all the different issues and contributors in the release notes is a good reminder that many small contributions add up to big results. When we all contribute in small ways, we can make a lot of progress together.
