# Apple picking at Brooksby Farm

The fall in New England brings a number traditions: [apple picking](https://dri.es/apple-picking-at-russell-orchards) being one of them, [pumpkin carving](https://dri.es/pumpkin-carving) being another. I'm also adding warm cider donuts to that list of traditions – given that they are made of apples, they must be full of vitamins, don't you think?
