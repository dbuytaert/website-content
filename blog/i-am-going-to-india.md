As you know, I'm no stranger to travel – I flew [over 100,000 km in 2010 and over 300,000 km in 2011](https://dri.es/drupal-2010-retrospective-and-2011-predictions). But India is one place I haven't visited yet, even though I feel that Drupal's success there is crucial to its worldwide adoption.

Besides having a [strong Drupal community](https://groups.drupal.org/india), India is one of the world's [fastest-growing economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(real)_growth_rate), with great promise to continue its rise for several years. Where a country's economy grows, so grows its need for online solutions. So the opportunities for Drupal there are obvious.

So I'm excited to be visiting this coming month. My schedule is:

- 7-8 November in Delhi
- 9-10 November in Mumbai
- 11 November in Hyderabad

My time will be split between events with the Drupal community, press meetings and private meetings with Acquia partners and customers. I'm grateful for volunteers who have been making plans in the [Drupal India group](https://groups.drupal.org/india). If you're local and would like to meet, be sure to check in there. Even if we can't meet, I'd especially appreciate Indians' comments of what you hope I know about Drupal in India when my trip is done.
