# Drupal is a Webware 100 winner

[image drupal/webware-100-winner-2007 resize=false]

The Drupal community deserves a lot of praise for their hard work and dedication, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that Drupal is a [CNET Webware 100 winner](http://www.webware.com/html/ww/100.html) in the publishing category. *Good job team!*

This is [what CNET has to say](http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9728770-2.html) about the results in the publishing category:

> Publishing had no mass consumer brands in the top 10, as most of the other categories did. [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) got the most votes. I was interested to see the [Drupal CMS platform](https://www.drupal.org/) placing high in this category – above the consumer-oriented publishing products [Typepad](https://www.typepad.com/) and [Vox](https://www.vox.com/). Even combined, these two [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com/) services didn't come close to winning the same number of votes as Drupal.
