# Acquia a Leader in the 2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms

Today, for the first time in our company's history, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) was named a Leader in [Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms (DXPs)](https://www.acquia.com/resources/whitepaper/2020-gartner-magic-quadrant-digital-experience-platforms). This is an incredible milestone for us.

In 2014, I declared that companies would need [more than a website or a CMS](https://dri.es/from-content-management-to-digital-experience-management) to deliver great customer experiences. Instead, they would need a DXP that could integrate lots of different marketing and customer success technologies, and operate across more digital channels (e.g. mobile, chat, voice, and more).

For five years, Acquia has diligently been building towards an "open DXP". As part of that, we expanded our product portfolio with solutions like [Lift](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift) (website personalization), and acquired two marketing companies: [Mautic](https://dri.es/acquia-acquires-mautic-to-create-the-open-digital-experience-platform) (marketing automation + email marketing), and [AgilOne](https://dri.es/acquia-acquires-agilone-to-solve-data-challenges-with-ai) (Customer Data Platform).

Being named a Leader by Gartner in the Digital Experience Platforms Magic Quadrant validates years and years of hard work, including [last year's acquisitions](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2019). We also join an amazing cohort of leaders, like Salesforce and Adobe, who are among the very best software companies in the world. All of this makes me incredibly proud of the Acquia team.

This recognition comes after six years as [a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management (WCM)](https://www.acquia.com/resources/whitepaper/2019-gartner-magic-quadrant-web-content-management). We learned recently that Gartner is deprecating its Web Content Management Magic Quadrant as Gartner clients' demand has been shifting to the broader scope of DXPs. We also see growing interest in DXPs from our clients, though we believe WCM and content will continue to play a foundational and critical role.
