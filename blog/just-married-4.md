I've been working with [Gábor Hojtsy](http://hojtsy.hu/) for almost 5 years. First as a contributor to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), next as [my Drupal 6 co-maintainer](https://dri.es/gabor-hojtsy), and more recently as a co-worker at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/). Yesterday, Gábor got married with Zsuzsi, so needless to say, a number of us traveled to Hungary to attend his wedding.

More pictures are available in [my photo gallery](https://dri.es/album/wedding-gabor-and-zsuzsi-2008/).

It was really wonderful to witness and take part in their wedding. We had a great meal and party on the river banks of the beautiful Danube. *Congratulations and may you continue to love one another forever!*
