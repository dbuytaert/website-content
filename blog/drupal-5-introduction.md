Robert Safuto of [Awakened Voice](http://www.awakenedvoice.com/) has done an excellent Drupal screencast. He takes you on [a 22 minute tour of Drupal 5](https://dri.es/files/drupal-5-tour.mov) (QuickTime, 22 min, 81 MB). If you're new to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and you want to learn more about the key features and configuration options, this screencast makes for an excellent start. *Recommended!*
