# Drupal and Bollekes

Not so long ago, [I wondered whether there was enough momentum for a Belgian Drupal User Group](/belgian-drupal-user-group). Well, Roel De Meester is organizing [the first Belgian Drupal User Group meeting](http://drupal.be/node/201). We're meeting on Saturday evening (October 28th, 19:30h) at [ViaVia in Antwerp](http://www.viavia.world/). *Drupal and [Bollekes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_beer)!*
