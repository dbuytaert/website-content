# Starting to work on Drupal 8

At DrupalCon Chicago I created the Drupal 8 development branch in front of a room full of core contributors. This means that we have officially started work on Drupal 8 and that I started to accept new features and improvements for Drupal 8, the next major version of Drupal.

In my State of Drupal presentation in Chicago I outlined what I believe should be the strategic direction for Drupal 8. If you want all the details, you can watch [a video recording of my keynote](https://archive.org/details/keynote_dries). If you don't want to watch the entire video, here is the executive summary:

1. Multi-device publishing (aka mobile); clean HTML/CSS, HTML5, contexts, web services APIs, etc
2. Interopability and integration with cloud services: web service APIs, pluggable components, clean data models, etc
3. Delightful experience: accessibility, usability, performance
4. Configuration management: better separation between content and configuration, universally unique identifiers (UUIDs), exportables, more consistent CRUD APIs, etc
5. Content staging

I plan to blog more about each of these topics in the next couple of months. In the mean time, let's continue all the conversations and let's start work. *Woot!*
