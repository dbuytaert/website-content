Sportswear manufacturer [Nike](http://nike.com) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for [their Beijing Olympics website](http://nikemedia.com/beijing/en/region/global). What is remarkable is that the content on the site is being translated to at least 13 languages (see language drop-down on screenshot). That is a testament to [Drupal 6's improved internationalization features](https://www.acquia.com/blog/kieran/ux-improvements-drupal-6-internationalization), and [further proof that I'm not crazy](https://dri.es/reaching-out-with-drupal-6). ;-)

If anyone is working on internationalization improvements for Drupal 7, let me know. I'm accepting patches ...
