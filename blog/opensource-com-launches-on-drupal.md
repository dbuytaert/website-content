[Red Hat](http://redhat.com) just launched [OpenSource.com](http://opensource.com) on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). The site will focus on exploring what happens when the open source way is applied to the world, beyond technology. The site has 5 main channels: business, education, government, law, and life. In each channel, they'll explore how open source is having an impact on each of those areas. The content is meant to be very conversational and participatory, making Drupal a natural choice. Needless to say, it is great to see Drupal being used to promote Open Source way beyond technology. It is also rewarding to see Red Hat, the mother of all Open Source companies, using Drupal.

Red Hat came to [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) to help them get the site built. Development was done by our friends at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.net/) (an Acquia partner), while Acquia provides support and hosting.
