I recently had the opportunity to read [Tiffany Farriss](https://www.drupal.org/u/farriss)' [Drupal Association Retrospective](https://www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-association-retrospective). In addition to being the CEO of [Palantir.net](https://www.palantir.net), Tiffany also served on the Drupal Association Board of Directors for nine years. In her retrospective post, Tiffany shares what the Drupal Association looked like when she joined the board in 2009, and how the Drupal Association continues to grow today.

What I really appreciate about Tiffany's retrospective is that it captures the evolution of the Drupal Association. It's easy to forget how far we've come. What started as a scrappy advisory board, with little to no funding, has matured into a nonprofit that can support and promote the mission of the Drupal project. While there is always work to be done, Tiffany's retrospective is a great testament of our community's progress.

I feel very lucky that the Drupal Association was able to benefit from Tiffany's leadership for nine years; she truly helped shape every aspect of the Drupal Association. I'm proud to have worked with Tiffany; she has been one of the most influential, talented members of our Board, and has been very generous by contributing both time and resources to the project.
