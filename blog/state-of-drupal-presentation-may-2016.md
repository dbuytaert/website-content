DrupalCon New Orleans comes at an important time in the history of Drupal. Now that [Drupal 8 has launched](https://dri.es/drupal-8-released), we have a lot of work to do to accelerate Drupal 8's adoption as well as plan what is next.

In my keynote presentation, I shared my thoughts on where we should focus our efforts in order for Drupal to continue its path to become the leading platform for assembling the world's best digital experiences.

Based on recent survey data, I proposed key initiatives for Drupal, as well as shared my vision for building cross-channel customer experiences that span various devices, including conversational technologies like [Amazon Echo](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R1CXKN7?ref=ods_surl_pl).

You can [watch a recording](https://youtu.be/Ksp5JVFryEg) of my keynote (starting at 3:43) or download a [copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-may-2016.pdf) (162 MB).

There is much more data hidden in the raw survey results, so if you'd like to do your own analysis, you can [download a copy of the raw survey results](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2016-raw.xls) ([CSV format](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2016-raw.csv) or [XLS format](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2016-raw.xls)) and look at the raw data yourself. I anonymized the data by removing the names, e-mail addresses and IP address information. If you decide to analyze the raw data, consider sharing your findings with all of us.

Take a look, and as always feel free to leave your opinions in the comments!
