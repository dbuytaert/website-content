Set back in the woods, in the [Vermont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont) foothills, only accessible by a dirt road, you'll find the perfect weekend cabin called the "Baby Barn".

On Saturday, Vanessa and I went on a 14 km (9 mile) hike, called "Griffith Lake Loop". It is part of the [Appalachian Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Trail). The hike took us more than 6 hours to complete. Not only did we have 640 meters (2,100 feet) of elevation gain, we also had to cross multiple streams, and hike through mud and snow. Because of the snow at higher altitudes, parts of the trail were hard to follow and quite exhausting. Two days later, my legs still hurt.
