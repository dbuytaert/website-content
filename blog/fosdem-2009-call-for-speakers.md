# FOSDEM 2009: call for speakers

Mark your agendas because the [Drupal project](https://www.drupal.org) got a developer room at [FOSDEM](http://fosdem.org) on Sunday, February 8, 2009. FOSDEM, which stands for *Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting*, is a yearly free and non-commercial event for the open source community, held in Brussels (Belgium). With more than 3,000 attendees coming from all over the world, FOSDEM is the biggest open source event in Europe.

Our goal is to use the developer room to meet, discuss, and talk about Drupal. Right now, we're looking for speakers so let us know in the [FOSDEM 2009 group](https://groups.drupal.org/fosdem-2009) if you want to give a presentation. Or, if you want me to present about a specific topic, you can let me know in the comments of this post. I'm always looking for good ideas. *Hope to see you at FOSDEM 2009!*
