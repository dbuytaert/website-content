# Drupal 6 released

Today, 13 months after the Drupal 5.0 release, we released Drupal 6.0 to the world. Read more about Drupal 6.0 in the [official release announcement](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6.0) or just look at the [What is new in Drupal 6.0?" screencast](http://www.masteringdrupal.com/screencast/new-features-drupal-6) (30 min) that we prepared.

Needless to say, Drupal 6 is our most exciting release to date. It is a legendary piece of work, by the community, for the community. Thanks to the hundreds of Drupal contributors for their tireless work and commitment!
