# ASI using Drupal

Drupal goes to space! ASI is in Italy what NASA is in the USA. In other words, ASI is the Italian national agency for space activities, and works primarily with ESA (European Space Agency) and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). Among their many projects include recent work on construction of the International Space Station. Turns out their site uses Drupal. Check it out at <http://www.asi.it>.
