The [Drupal Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/starshot) initiative has been making significant progress behind the scenes, and I'm excited to share some updates with the community.

### Leadership team formation and product definition

Over the past few months, we've been working diligently on [Drupal Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/starshot). One of our first steps was to [appoint a leadership team](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-starshot-leadership-team) to guide the project. With the leadership team in place as well as the new [Starshot Advisory Council](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-starshot-advisory-council), we shifted our focus to defining the product. We've made substantial progress on this front and will be sharing more details about the product strategy in the coming weeks.

### Introducing Drupal Starshot tracks

We already started to break down the initiative into manageable components, and are introducing the concept of "tracks". Tracks are smaller, focused parts of the Drupal Starshot project that allow for targeted development and contributions. We've already published the first set of tracks on the [Drupal Starshot issue queue on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/project/starshot/issues/3454529).

Example tracks include:

1. Creating [Drupal Recipes](https://youtu.be/YGomGmiMM90?) for features like contact forms, advanced search, events, SEO and more.
2. Enhancing the Drupal installer to enable Recipes during installation.
3. Updating Drupal.org for Starshot, including product marketing and a trial experience.

While many tracks are technical and need help from developers, most of the tracks need contribution from designers, UX experts, marketers, testers and site builders.

### Recruiting more track leads

Several tracks already have track leads and have made significant progress:

- [Matt Glaman](https://www.drupal.org/u/mglaman) is spearheading the development of a trial experience.
- The marketing team, led by [Suzanne Dergacheva](https://www.drupal.org/u/pixelite), is crafting product marketing documentation.
- [Martin Anderson-Clutz](https://www.drupal.org/u/mandclu) has been appointed as the track lead for event management.

However, we need many additional track leads to drive our remaining tracks to completion.

We're now accepting applications for [track lead positions](https://www.drupal.org/node/3461550). Interested individuals and organizations can apply by completing our [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsylj5n2iPm3fcmnp3e-nNLwmaE-BiONcLU8HrPdP_jhw8WQ/viewform). The application window closes on July 31st, two weeks from today.

### Key responsibilities of a track lead

Track leads can be individuals, teams, or organizations, including [Drupal Certified Partners](https://www.drupal.org/association/become-a-drupal-certified-partner). While technical expertise is beneficial, the role primarily focuses on strategic coordination and project management. Key responsibilities include:

- Defining and validating requirements to ensure the track meets the expectations of our target audience.
- Developing and maintaining a prioritized task list, including creating milestones and timelines.
- Overseeing and driving the track's implementation.
- Collaborating with key stakeholders, including the Drupal Starshot leadership team, module maintainers, the marketing team, etc.
- Communicating progress to the community (e.g. blogging).

### Track lead selection and announcement

After the application deadline, the Drupal Starshot Leadership Team will review the applications and appoint track leads. We expect to announce the selected track leads in the first week of August.

While the application period is open, we will be available to answer any questions you may have. Feel free to reach out to us through the Drupal.org issue queue, or join us in an upcoming zoom meeting (details to be announced / figured out).

### Looking ahead to DrupalCon Barcelona

Our goal is to make significant progress on these tracks by [DrupalCon Barcelona](https://events.drupal.org/barcelona2024), where we plan to showcase the advancements we've made. We're excited about the momentum building around Drupal Starshot and can't wait to see the contributions from the community.

If you're passionate about Drupal and want to play a key role in shaping its future, consider applying for a track lead position.

Stay tuned for more updates on Drupal Starshot, and thank you for your continued support of the Drupal community.
