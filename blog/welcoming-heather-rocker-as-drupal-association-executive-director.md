# Welcoming Heather Rocker as Drupal Association Executive Director

The Drupal Association announced today that Heather Rocker has been [selected as its next Executive Director.](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-appoints-executive-director-heather-rocker)

This is exciting news because it concludes a seven month search since [Megan Sanicki left](https://dri.es/farewell-megan-but-not-goodbye).

We looked long and hard for someone who could help us grow the global [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/) by building on its diversity, working with developers and agency partners, and expanding our work with new audiences such as content creators and marketers.

The Drupal Association (including me) believes that Heather can do all of that, and is the best person to help lead Drupal into its next phase of growth.

Heather earned her engineering degree from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). She has dedicated much of her career to working with women in technology, both as the CEO of [Girls, Inc. of Greater Atlanta](http://www.girlsincatl.org/) and the Executive Director of [Women in Technology](https://www.mywit.org/).

We were impressed not only with her valuable experience with volunteer organizations, but also her work in the private sector with large customers. Most recently, Heather was part of the management team at Systems Evolution, a team of 250 business consultants, where she specialized in sales operations and managed key client relationships.

She is also a robotics fanatic who organizes and judges competitions for children. So, maybe we'll see some robots roaming around DrupalCon in the future!

As you can tell, Heather will bring a lot of great experience to the Drupal community and I look forward to partnering with her.

Last but not least, I want to thank Tim Lehnen for serving as our Interim Executive Director. He did a fantastic job leading the Drupal Association through this transition.
