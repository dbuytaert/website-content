# The freedom to leave is what makes customers stay

[image acquia/acquia-source-door lazy=false priority=true]

When I tell people that [Acquia Source](https://dri.es/the-product-we-should-not-have-killed) will let customers export their _entire_ website and leave our platform anytime, I usually get puzzled looks. 

We really mean the entire site: the underlying Drupal code, theme, configuration, content, and data. The export gives you a complete, working Drupal site that you can run on any infrastructure you choose.

Most SaaS platforms do the opposite. They make it hard to leave. When you export, you may get all your content, but never the code.

Why do we want to make it easy for customers to leave?

First, when leaving is easy, customers stay because they want to, not because they are trapped. That accountability pushes us to build better products. It means that at Acquia, we have to earn our customers' business every day by delivering value, not by making it hard to leave. 

Second, the ability to leave means teams can start small and scale without hitting a wall. All SaaS products have constraints, and Acquia Source is no exception. When your application reaches a level of complexity that requires deeper customization, you can take your entire site to Acquia Cloud or any other Drupal hosting environment.  You never need to start over.

Last but not least, because Acquia Source is built on Drupal, we want it to reflect [Drupal's open source freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en). Full export is how we make those principles real in a SaaS context.

We call this Open SaaS. 

We first tried this idea with Drupal Gardens in 2010, which [also allowed full exports](https://dri.es/open-source-in-the-enterprise-and-in-the-cloud). I loved that feature then, and I still love it now. I have always believed it was a big deal. More importantly, our customers did too.

One of Acquia's largest customers began on Drupal Gardens more than a decade ago. They used it to explore Drupal, then naturally grew into Acquia Cloud and Site Factory as their needs became more complex. Today they run some of the world's biggest media properties on Drupal and Acquia.

Trust comes from freedom, not lock-in. The exit door you'll never use is exactly what makes you confident enough to stay. It does seem counterintuitive to make leaving easy, but not all SaaS is created equal. With our Open SaaS approach, you get the freedom to grow and the ability to leave whenever you choose.
