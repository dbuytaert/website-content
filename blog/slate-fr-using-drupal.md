While in France for the [Drupal.org redesign code sprint in Paris](https://dri.es/drupal-org-redesign-code-sprints-update-2), it was pointed out by a number of people that [Slate.fr](http://slate.fr), the French version of the popular culture magazine Slate, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Slate is owned by the [The Washington Post Company](http://www.washpostco.com/).
