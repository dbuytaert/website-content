# Drupal 11 released

[image drupal/drupal-11-launch schema=false]

Today is a big day for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) as we officially released Drupal 11!

In recent years, we've seen an uptick in innovation in Drupal. Drupal 11 continues this trend with many new and exciting features. You can see an overview of these improvements in the video below:

Drupal 11 has been out for less than six hours, and updating my personal site was my first order of business this morning. I couldn't wait! Dri.es is now running on Drupal 11.

I'm particularly excited about two key features in this release, which I believe are transformative and will likely reshape Drupal in the years ahead:

1. **Recipes (experimental):** This feature allows you to add new features to your website by applying a set of predefined configurations.
2. **Single-Directory Components:** SDCs simplify front-end development by providing a component-based workflow where all necessary code for each component lives in a single, self-contained directory.

These two new features represent a major shift in how developers and site builders will work with Drupal, setting the stage for even greater improvements in future releases. For example, we'll rely heavily on them in [Drupal Starshot](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-starshot).

Drupal 11 is the result of contributions from 1,858 individuals across 590 organizations. These numbers show how strong and healthy Drupal is. Community involvement remains one of Drupal's greatest strengths. Thank you to everyone who contributed to Drupal 11!
