Not only is there a new tour, but [MichaelJackson.com](http://community.michaeljackson.com/), the official site for fans of the King of Pop, has just re-launched, featuring some new community-oriented features and some old-school graphics from back in the day. [MichaelJackson.com](http://community.michaeljackson.com/) was built using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) by the good folks at Sony Music. They are also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect against comment and forum post spam. *Moonwalks!*
