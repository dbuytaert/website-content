# MIT's Emerging Technologies Conference

Funny anecdote: I was waiting backstage to go on stage for my [TR35 elevator pitch](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/) on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) at [MIT's Emerging Technologies Conference](https://www.technologyreview.com/emtech/), scheduled to be directly after [Craig Mundie](https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/craig/)'s keynote presentation. (Craig is one of the two people that replace Bill Gates now he is retired.) When he walked off the stage, he stopped and jokingly said "*Good luck, I warmed up the audience for you.*". He probably didn't know that I was going to talk about Open Source software. ;-)

Either way, it is a great testament for all of us who work on Drupal that MIT recognizes Drupal as an important emerging technology, and that we are now on the radar of even more great technology leaders. *Rock on!*
