# Acquia raises $55 million series G

Today, we're excited to announce that [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) has closed a $55 million financing round, bringing total investment in the company to $188.6 million. Led by new investor [Centerview Capital Technology](https://www.centerviewcapital.com/technology/), the round includes existing investors [New Enterprise Associates (NEA)](http://www.nea.com) and [Split Rock Partners](http://splitrock.com).

We are in the middle of a big technological and economic shift, driven by the web, in how large organizations and industries operate. At Acquia, we have set out to build the best platform for helping organizations run their businesses online, help them invent new ways of doing business, and maximize their digital impact on the world. What Acquia does is not at all easy – or cheap – but we've made good strides towards that vision. We have become the backbone for many of the world's most influential digital experiences and continue to grow fast. In the process, we are charting new territory with a very unique business model rooted [Drupal](https://drupal.com) and Open Source.

A fundraise like this helps us scale our global operations, sales and marketing as well as the development of our solutions for building, delivering and optimizing digital experiences. It also gives us flexibility. I'm proud of what we have accomplished so far, and I'm excited about the big opportunity ahead of us.
