# My re-entry from vacation

Today is the first day back from my two-week vacation. We started [our vacation in Maine](https://dri.es/our-vacation-at-acadia-national-park), and we ended our vacation with a few days in Italy.

While I did some work on vacation, it was my first two-week vacation since starting Acquia 11 years ago.

This morning when the alarm went off I thought: *"Why is my alarm going off in the middle of the night?"*. A few moments later, reality struck. It's time to go back to work.

Going on vacation is like going to space. Lots of work before take-off, followed by serenity and peaceful floating around in space, eventually abrupted by an insane re-entry process into the earth's atmosphere.

I got up early this morning to work on my "re-entry" and prioritize what I have to do this week. It's a lot!

[Drupal Europe](https://www.drupaleurope.org/) is only one week away and I have to make a lot of progress on [my keynote presentation](https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal) and prepare for other sessions and meetings. Between now and Drupal Europe, I also have two analyst meetings (Forrester and Gartner), three board meetings, and dozens of meetings to catch up with co-workers, projects, partners and customers. Plus, I would love to write about the upcoming Drupal 8.6.0 release and publish [my annual "Who sponsors Drupal development?" report](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-sponsors). Lots to do this week, but all things I'm excited about.

If you're expecting to hear from me, know that it might take me several weeks to dig out.
