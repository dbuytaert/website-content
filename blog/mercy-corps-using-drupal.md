[Mercycorps.org](http://mercycorps.org), the public website for Mercy Corps, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Mercy Corps is a humanitarian aid agency headquartered in Portland that works in over 40 countries worldwide.

Mercycorps.org just brought in more than $4 million USD for Haiti relief. They used the [boost module](https://www.drupal.org/project/boost) to handle the tremendous flood of traffic that they received the last couple of weeks. Over $500K USD of the money was raised through [Personal fundraising pages](https://www.mercycorps.org/fundraising), which are nodes that donors create and then send to their friends. They had over 2,000 people sign up for Mercy Corps (Drupal) accounts and create *Personal fundraising pages*. The fundraising pages are still going strong and raising thousands of dollars for Haiti relief every day.

The site was built by their in-house web team with support from the Portland Drupal community.

Stories like this make me want to work on Drupal. It is absolutely rewarding to see that Drupal can help enable organizations like Mercy Corps. In addition to indirect help through Drupal, my wife and I have also made a monetary contribution for the victims in Haiti.
