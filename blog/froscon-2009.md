This weekend, I will be giving the keynote presentation at [FrOSCon](http://froscon.org) in Sankt Augustin Germany, near Bonn. There will be a dedicated Drupal developer room there on both Saturday and Sunday (August 22 and 23). FrOSCon is a relatively new, but rapidly growing conference covering open source technologies of all kinds. This is the fourth year that Drupal has been involved and it has become one of the most important Drupal events to attend every year in Germany.

On Saturday we'll we having a Drupal 7 code sprint, coordinated via IRC (#drupal at FreeNode) and Twitter so that local and remote developers can cooperate in real time. Angie Byron, my Drupal 7 co-maintainer, will be with us the whole time live on IRC from Canada. She is pulling an all-nighter for us, so let's make sure to get some hot patch action! Anyone whose time zone is remotely compatible is invited to join us – the sprint will run roughly from 10:00h to 18:00h European Central Summer Time (6 hours ahead of US Eastern).

On Sunday, there will be several Drupal presentations in the developer room as well as lots of chances to meet other Drupalistas, get support, install Drupal on your machine and so on. There is a planning wiki for the Drupal side of the event at: https://groups.drupal.org/node/24601. My keynote presentation will be at 12:45h on Sunday "The Secrets of Building and Participating in Open Source Communities".

Keynote abstract:

*Everyone knows that the most successful open source projects and vendors benefit from a thriving community. But how exactly is this done? In this session, Drupal project lead and Acquia co-founder and CTO Dries Buytaert will share his secrets for building and participating in a thriving open source community, including its commercial ecosystem. He'll describe the mindset, mechanisms, and practices that are essential for a thriving project and community.*

Hope to see you there!
