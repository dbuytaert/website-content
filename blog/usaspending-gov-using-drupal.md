Vivek Kundra, the CIO of the United States, unveiled the new [IT spending dashboards at usaspending.gov](http://it.usaspending.gov) earlier this week. Tim O'Reilly has all the details in his blog post titled [Radical transparency: the new federal IT dashboard](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/06/radical-transparency-federal-it-dashboard.html). In short, the dashboards are designed to help CIOs of individual government agencies get a handle on the effectiveness of government IT spending. The site was built with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org).

This is a fundamental change in the way government is going to be run, and it is great to see Drupal play a small role in that. *Great stuff!*
