# Extraordinary glimpse of Acquia Client Advisors in action

Working at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) often means taking on the hard problems, the big challenges, and making the difference between success and failure for our customers. To highlight just how flexible our *Client Advisory Team* needs to be on a daily basis, I want to share with you this extraordinary glimpse into the inner workings of a **real life customer** who was dealing with a Drupal problem they never even imagined could exist. Please be warned, this is a real screenshot of a real "support incident" - nothing has been held back, except the customer's name (for their own protection). For the truly daring, there is also a [high resolution version](https://dri.es/files/images/acquia/support-ticket-jingle.jpg).
