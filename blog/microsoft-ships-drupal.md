# Microsoft ships Drupal

Microsoft just announced the [Web Application Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/channel/products/WebApplicationInstaller.aspx). It is an installer designed to help get users of the Windows operating system up and running with some popular web applications. Guess what? It comes with support for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). I don't know enough about their roadmap but this could introduce Drupal to thousands of new users. Oh my!

From the [Web Application Installer page](https://www.microsoft.com/web/channel/products/WebApplicationInstaller.aspx):

> Web Application Installer provides support for popular ASP.Net and PHP Web applications including Graffiti, DotNetNuke, WordPress, Drupal, OSCommerce and more. With just a few simple clicks, Web Application Installer will check your machine for the necessary pre-requisites, download these applications from their source location in the community, walk you through basic configuration items and then install them on your computer.

I don't have a Windows machine so I can't test it out, but it sounds like a great way for Windows users to explore Drupal. (Hat tip: [Jelle Druyts](http://jelle.druyts.net/))
