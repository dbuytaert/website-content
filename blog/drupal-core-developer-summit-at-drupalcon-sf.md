# Drupal core developer summit at DrupalCon SF

On Saturday, April 17th, before [DrupalCon San Francisco](https://sf2010.drupal.org/), I'm helping to organize the very first [Drupal core developer summit](https://sf2010.drupal.org/conference/core-developer-summit). The goal of the *Drupal core developer summit* is to talk about ways we can improve Drupal core, and the core development processes, all while having a good time socializing with fellow core developers.

To make it lively and fun, we'll do a series of 10 minute [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Talk). In between the lightning talks, we'll have a number of meatier discussions or breakout sessions. The lightning talks will be divided in two categories: the first 8 lightning talks will take the format: *"Why X sucks and how to improve it"* where X can be anything in Drupal core; the last 8 lightning talks will take the format *"Wouldn't it be awesome if ..."*. The idea behind the lightning talks is to educate core contributors about problems that need to be fixed, to present foundations for solutions, and to bootstrap collaboration.

The event is open to all, but ... in order to attend, **you must be prepared to do a 10 minute lightning talk**. To secure a ticket to the *Drupal core developer summit*, you have to [submit a 4 slide presentation by March 17th, 2010](https://sf2010.drupal.org/core-developer-summit).

We expect one background slide to provide context or to talk about the history of the problem, one slide with a clear problem statement, and a couple of slides to propose a solution. You can focus on big things (i.e. *How session management can be made more scalable*) or smaller things (i.e. *Why `drupal_get_schema()` is slow and how to make it faster*). Everyone who submitted slides ahead of time will be invited to attend. All slides will be shared publicly, but not everyone will be invited to present as we'll only have time for 16 lightning talks. Some talks will be hand-picked because they are important or particularly intriguing, other talks will be randomly selected the day of the event.

This should be a lot of fun!
