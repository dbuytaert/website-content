InfoWorld relaunched on Drupal 6 yesterday! Check out their new site at <http://infoworld.com>. InfoWorld has been around since 1978 and is a well-known resource for IT professionals. I hope they write up a use case because it is a great testament to Drupal 6.

The project was done by [Optaros](http://optaros.com) (an [Acquia partner](https://www.acquia.com/partners)), with help from [Airbag Industries](http://airbagindustries.com/) for the design work. [Chris Fuller](https://www.drupal.org/user/61928) was the project lead.
