# Belgium.be using Drupal

[Belgium.be](http://belgium.be), the official website of Belgium, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) at <http://forum2010.belgium.be>. This forum site has been put together in preparation for [our Presidency of the Council of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_the_Council_of_the_European_Union) in the second half of 2010.

Perhaps the most remarkable aspect is the fact that the site was built in less than 10 days. The Chancellorship of the Prime Minister picked [Connexion](http://connexion.be) to build this site with the help of [Internet Architects](http://www.internetarchitects.be).

The site is available in 4 languages so all Belgian citizens can express their opinions and engage in interactive discussions about European issues.
