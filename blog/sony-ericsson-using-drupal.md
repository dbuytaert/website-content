Sony Ericsson's first [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) web site was officially launched yesterday at the [JavaOne conference](http://java.sun.com/javaone/). The site, called [Sony Ericsson Labs](http://labs.sonyericsson.com/), is a community website to shares application concepts with everyone who is interested in mobile applications and where new ideas can begin to take shape.

The site was designed and implemented by [NodeOne](http://nodeone.se) in [462 hours with a team of five persons](http://nodeone.se/blogg/drupal/sony-ericsson-using-drupal). *Impressive!*
