When we launched [Drupal CMS 1.0](https://dri.es/drupal-cms-1-released) eleven months ago, I posted the announcement on Reddit. Brave of me, I know. But I wanted non-Drupal people to actually try it.

There were a lot of positive reactions, but there was also honest feedback. The most common? "Wake me up when your new experience builder is ready". The message was clear: make page building easier and editing more visual.

I was not surprised. For years I have heard the same frustration. Drupal is powerful, but not always easy to use. That criticism has been fair. We have never lacked capability, but we have not always delivered the user experience people expect.

Well, wake up.

Today we released [Drupal Canvas 1.0](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-canvas-is-now-available-inside-drupals-new-visual-page-builder), a new visual page builder for Drupal. You can create reusable components that match your design system, drag them on to a page, edit content in place, preview changes across multiple pages, and undo mistakes with ease.

Watch the video below. Better yet, show it to someone who thinks they know what Drupal looks like. I bet their first reaction will be: "Wait, is that Drupal?". That reaction is exactly what we have been working toward.  It makes Drupal feel more modern and less intimidating.

I also want to set expectations. Drupal Canvas 1.0 helps us catch up with other page builders more than it helps us leap ahead. We had to start there.

But it helps us catch up in the right way, bringing the ease of modern tools while keeping Drupal's identity intact. This isn't Drupal becoming simpler by becoming less powerful. Drupal Canvas sits on top of everything that makes Drupal so powerful: structured content, fine-grained permissions, scalability, and much more. 

Most importantly, it opens new doors. Frontend developers can create components in React without having to learn Drupal first. And as shown in [my DrupalCon Vienna keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-october-2025), Drupal Canvas will have an AI assistant that can generate pages from natural language prompts. 

Drupal Canvas is [a remarkable piece of engineering](https://www.drupal.org/project/canvas). The team at Acquia and contributors across the community put serious craft into this. You can see it in the result. I'm thankful for the time, care, and skill everyone brought to it.

So what is next? We keep building. Drupal Canvas 1.0 is step one, and this is a good moment for more of the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/) to get involved. Now is the time to build on it, test it, and improve it. Especially because Drupal CMS 2.0 ships in less than two months with Drupal Canvas included. 

Shipping Drupal Canvas 1.0 is a major milestone. It shows we are listening. And it shows what we can accomplish when we focus on the experience as much as the capability. I cannot wait to see what people build with it.
