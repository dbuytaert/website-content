# British Government using Drupal

The British Government is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) on an innovation initiative to encourage developers and designers share new ideas and showcase their work: see <http://innovate.direct.gov.uk>. Directgov's main site, <http://www.direct.gov.uk> is the official government website for citizens. It provides information and services from across government organizations.
