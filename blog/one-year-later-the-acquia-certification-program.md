A little over a year ago [we launched the Acquia Certification Program for Drupal](https://dri.es/acquia-certification-for-drupal). We ended up the first year with close to 1,000 exams taken, which exceeded our goal of 300-600. Today, I'm pleased to announce that the Acquia Certification Program passed another major milestone with over [1,000 exams passed](https://certification.acquia.com/) (not just taken).

People have debated the pros and cons of software certifications for years ([including myself](https://dri.es/on-drupal-certification-programs)) so I want to give an update on our certification program and some of the lessons learned.

Acquia's certification program has been a big success. A lot of Drupal users require Acquia Certification; from the Australian government to Johnson &amp; Johnson. We also see many of our agency partners use the program as a tool in the hiring process. While a certification exam can not guarantee someone will be great at their job (e.g. we only test for technical expertise, not for [attitude](https://dri.es/attitude-beats-experience)), it does give a frame of reference to work from. The feedback we have heard time and again is how the [Acquia Certification Program](https://www.acquia.com/customer-success/learning-services/acquia-certification-program) is tough, but fair; validating skills and knowledge that are important to both customers and partners.

We also made the [Certification Magazine Salary Survey](http://certmag.com/digital/Feb2015/files/25.html) as having one of the most desired credentials to obtain. To be a first year program identified among certification leaders like Cisco and Red Hat speaks volumes on the respect our program has established.

Creating a global certification program is resource intensive. We've learned that it requires the commitment of a team of Drupal experts to work on each and every exam. We now have four different exams: developer, front-end specialist, backend specialist and site builder. It roughly takes 40 work days for the initial development of one exam, and about 12 to 18 work days for each exam update. We update all four of our exams several times per year. In addition to creating and maintaining the certification programs, there is also the day-to-day operations for running the program, which includes providing support to participants and ensuring the exams are in place for testing around the globe, both on-line and at test centers. However, we believe that effort is worth it, given the overall positive effect on our community.

We also learned that benefits are an important part to participants and that we need to raise the profile of someone who achieves these credentials, especially those with the new [Acquia Certified Grand Master credential](https://dev.acquia.com/blog/acquia-certified-grand-master-2015-now-here) (those who passed all three developer exams). We have a special [Grand Master Registry](https://certification.acquia.com//grand-masters) and look to create a platform for these Grand Masters to help share their expertise and thoughts. We do believe that if you have a Grand Master working on a project, you have a tremendous asset working in your favor.

At DrupalCon LA, the Acquia Certification Program offered a test center at the event, and we ended up having 12 new Grand Masters by the end of the conference. We saw several companies stepping up to challenge their best people to achieve Grand Master status. We plan to offer the testing at DrupalCon Barcelona, so take advantage of the convenience of the on-site test center and the opportunity to meet and talk with Peter Manijak, who developed and leads our certification efforts, myself and an Acquia Certified Grand Master or two about Acquia Certification and how it can help you in your career!
