# Acquia a leader in the 2021 Forrester Wave for Agile Content Management Systems

This research replaces [Forrester's Wave on Web Content Management Systems](https://dri.es/acquia-a-leader-in-the-2018-forrester-wave-for-web-content-management-systems). The focus is now on "agile content management" instead of "web content management". This change makes sense given the way people consume content today. Because consumers shift between channels when researching a brand or product, organizations need a back end that can support different end points (e.g. web, mobile, kiosks, voice assistants, etc).

The analysts note: <q>The \[Acquia\] platform shined in developer and practitioner tooling, with superior capabilities in front-end components and backend extensibility of the platform.</q>.
