I recently was able to obtain the domain name [dri.es](https://dri.es) so I decided to make the switch from [buytaert.net](http://buytaert.net) to [dri.es](https://dri.es). I made the switch because my first name is a lot easier to remember and pronounce than my last name. It's bittersweet because I've been blogging on [buytaert.net](http://buytaert.net) for almost 12 years now. The plan is to stick with [dri.es](https://dri.es) for the rest of the blog's life so it's worth the change. Old links to [buytaert.net](http://buytaert.net) will automatically be redirected, but if you can, please update your RSS feeds and other links you might have to my website.
