After [CSAIL started using Drupal](https://dri.es/mit-using-drupal) (the group where [Tim-Berners Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) works), the [MIT Media Lab](http://soon.media.mit.edu/) also switched to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Check out there Drupal site at <http://media.mit.edu>. As a former academic and a long term admirer of the MIT Media Lab, I think that is just really cool!
