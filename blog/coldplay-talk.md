# Coldplay - Talk

I don't always like Coldplay, but when I do, I like them a lot. To me, this song is about being uncertain and lost, and not being able to talk.

I like the imperfect and acoustic version that I embedded below, but you may want to check out [the official version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uqLM1uj_k).
