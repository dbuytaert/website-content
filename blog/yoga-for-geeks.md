I attended my first-ever yoga class at the [Open Source CMS Summit](/open-source-cms-summit) here in Vancouver. [Sarah Pullman](http://www.sarahpullman.com/) organized a "Yoga for Geeks" class. Sarah, a Drupal user herself, showed us some simple exercises that (admittedly somewhat to my surprise) turned out to reveal and relieve quite a bit of muscle tension amongst us Drupal developers. Highly recommended and a must-have session on future Drupal conferences.
