It has been exactly one month since [we released Drupal 4.7.0](https://dri.es/drupal-4-7-released) and we have nearly broken 50,000 downloads. The [Drupal 4.7 videocasts](https://www.drupal.org/videocasts) have been watched over 25,000 times, and have added 400GB of traffic to our monthly bandwidth usage. *Not too shabby.*
