# Comment notifications via e-mail

I would like to have a module for Drupal 6 that can send comment notifications via e-mail to people that previously left a comment on my site. I don't want to use the [subscriptions module](https://www.drupal.org/project/subscriptions) for I don't need a bulky *subscriptions framework*. I want a light-weight and simple alternative such as the [notify module](https://www.drupal.org/project/notify) but apparently it is no longer being maintained. A module like [notify module](https://www.drupal.org/project/notify) would make a good candidate for inclusion into Drupal core so let's port it to Drupal 6, and work on getting it into Drupal 7. *Takers?*
