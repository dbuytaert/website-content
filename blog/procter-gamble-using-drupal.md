# Procter & Gamble using Drupal

Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) is a [Fortune 500](https://dri.es/tag/fortune-500), multinational corporation that manufactures a wide range of consumer goods such as Gillette, Ariel, Pampers, Duracell, Braun and much more. With annual sales in excess of $83 billion USD, they are the 8th largest corporation in the world by market capitalization. Guess what? They are using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for a microsite at <https://www.pgsupplier.com/>. The site provides easy access to information for prospective and current Procter &amp; Gamble suppliers. The site doesn't look pretty, but given Drupal's bottom up grassroots adoption, this could be a big deal nonetheless.
