# Puerto Rico

Last week, we flew everyone at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) that joined before 2011, as well as their significant others (or someone of their choice) to the Caribbean to celebrate an incredible year. I wrote about the trip in my blog post titled ["Acquia goes to the Caribbean"](https://dri.es/acquia-goes-to-the-caribbean). Now we're back from this amazing trip, I've uploaded my pictures to [my Puerto Rico 2011 album](https://dri.es/album/puerto-rico-2011/) and included some below. *Work hard, live hard!*
