# Opel Antwerp going south

[image miscellaneous-2010/opel-going-south]

Taken with my Panasonic GF1 and the Lumix 20mm f1.7 pancake lens while I was waiting in our car for my wife to buy some ham and cheese. Handheld, no flash, but edited in Adobe Lightroom. I love the camera's shallow depth of field.
