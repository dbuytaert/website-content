# South African Government using Drupal

The South African Government is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for [their official 2010 FIFA World Cup website](http://www.sa2010.gov.za) at [http://www.sa2010.gov.za](http://www.sa2010.gov.za/). With the start of the 2010 World Cup just hours away, this is a timely discovery and a nice win for Drupal. The site was built by [eConsultant](http://econsultant.co.za/). *(Hat tip: [Usamah](https://twitter.com/simsimt))*
