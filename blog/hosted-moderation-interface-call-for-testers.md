We're about to launch a new add-on product in private beta at [Mollom](https://mollom.com). That new product is effectively a "hosted moderation interface". Our goals are to:

1. Provide an optimized and intelligent moderation interface – sort and bulk moderate comments by spam score, profanity content and more.
2. Make it easier to moderate multiple websites – moderate all your sites from a single, unified moderation interface.
3. Make it easier to support moderation teams – create moderation teams, define their workflows and track the performance of individual team members.
4. Provide moderation as a service – seamlessly outsource the moderation of your site fully or partially to a dedicated team.

The product is a work in progress, but we believe we'll soon be able to accept a limited number of private beta test users. If you're interested in being an early beta tester, [sign up here](https://www.mollom.com/beta) or leave a comment on this post.
