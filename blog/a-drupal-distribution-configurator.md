Today, [Commerce Guys](https://commerceguys.com) shared [a new initiative for Drupal Commerce](https://commerceguys.com/blog/whats-plan-commerce-kickstart-drupal-8). They launched a "Drupal Commerce distribution configurator": a web-based UI that [generates a `composer.json` file](https://github.com/smmccabe/accompanist) and builds a version of Drupal Commerce that is tailored to an evaluator's needs. The ability to visually configure your own distribution or demo is appealing. I like the idea of a Drupal distribution configurator for at least three reasons: (1) its development could lead to improvements to Drupal's [Composer-based workflow](https://getcomposer.org), which would benefit all of Drupal, (2) it could help [make distributions easier to build and maintain](https://dri.es/distributions-remain-a-growing-opportunity-for-drupal), which is something I'm passionate about, and last but not least, (3) it could grow into a more polished Drupal evaluator tool.
