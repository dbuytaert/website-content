Sanyo, the Fortune 500 electronics company, used [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) to build a [nice product catalog website](http://www.sanyo.com.au/) at [http://www.sanyo.com.au](http://www.sanyo.com.au/). The site went live earlier this week and features 250 products in 30 categories with over one GB of PDF files. More functionality is being added iteratively.

It sounds like they would be an ideal candidate for [Acquia's upcoming hosted search service](https://dri.es/a-hosted-search-service-for-drupal) which will be able to search PDF documents as well as regular Drupal content. According to Luke Schreur from [Tequila Digital Australia](http://www.tequila.com.au), the company responsible for the implementation, CCK was the most important module for this project. Luke said that they are already deploying Drupal for other clients and that more programmers at Tequila Digital are getting into Drupal. *Great!*
