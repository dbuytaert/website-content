[Tidelift](https://www.tidelift.com), which provides organizations with commercial-grade support for Open Source software and pays part of the proceeds to software maintainers, [raises a $25 million Series B](https://blog.tidelift.com/25m-to-scale-tidelift-for-open-source-creators-and-users). I hadn't heard about Tidelift before, but it turns out their office is 300 meters from Acquia's. I reached out and we're going to grab a coffee soon.
