# Indymedia and Drupal

[Indymedia ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Media_Center) is a network of autonomous independent news centers from around the globe. They take a strongly left-wing perspective on political issues and have an anti-capitalist bias. Turns out that more and more Indymedia websites start using Drupal, including the [Belgian Indymedia website](http://www.indymedia.be/). They are self-organizing on [this Indymedia-Drupal wiki page](http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Devel/ImcDrupalDev).
