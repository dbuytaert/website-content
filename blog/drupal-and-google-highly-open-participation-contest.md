Following on from the [success of the Google Summer of Code program](https://dri.es/google-to-invest-100000-usd-in-drupal), Drupal has been chosen as one of the ten projects participating in a new pilot program called [Google Highly Open Participation Contest](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8/). The goal of the program is to get high-school students involved in all aspects of Open Source development, from fixing bugs to writing documentation and doing user experience research.

I think this is a great idea. Clearly, the internet is doing more than making our kids fat. Repeatedly, I have been blown away with what today's high-school students are capable off. Why not recognize that and get them involved more?

So for every 3 tasks they complete, they get a t-shirt, $100 USD and most of all; Open Source experience. Having experience with Open Source software development is becoming an increasingly valuable asset on any future developer's resume. It is worth a lot more than a few hundred bucks.

We already entered [a number of Drupal tasks](https://code.google.com/archive/p/google-highly-open-participation-drupal/issues) in preparation of the announcement, but more tasks can still be added. Let's put a thousand students to work, learn and participate! *Thanks Google!*
