# Drupal mentioned in Forbes

[image drupal/forbes-2009]

Drupal was mentioned in [Forbes](http://forbes.com) as part of an article called "[Social networking terms you should know](https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/22/tech-starter-kit-ent-tech-cx_br_1022socialnetworkingglossary.html)". Great to see our work being recognized by Forbes. *Super!*
