[Turbinegeneration](http://turbinegeneration.tate.org.uk) is a new online community that allows students in schools around the world to contribute, comment and rate each other's artwork. The goal is to invite art students worldwide to make a work of art specifically for [Tate Modern](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern), one of the most-visited modern art galleries in the world.

The site is based on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Web design firm [BrightLemon London](http://www.brightlemon.com) was chosen to build the online community.
