# Obama using Drupal

This afternoon, in Denver, Colorado, President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known in US political circles as the "stimulus bill".

The bill provides new spending, tax cuts and aid to state and local governments all totaling almost $800 billion US dollars, making it the largest spending bill in that nation's history. Designed to create jobs and provide a boost to a sagging economy, the bill focuses on green, renewable energy and investments in health care technology.

Of immediate interest to us, however, is the accompanying website, [recovery.gov](http://recovery.gov), which – you guessed it – is using Drupal!

Drupal is no stranger to the political arena, and has been used for many campaign and government sites before. Recovery.gov, though, is a definite coup for Drupal – there are not many Drupal sites that have [their own post on Whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/09/02/14/A-major-milestone/). Or [on the Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/17/recoverygov-white-house-w_n_167591.html). Or is featured on CNN all day long. Or has its own [YouTube promo by the US President](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkclCf6yTUo). *Unbelievable!*
