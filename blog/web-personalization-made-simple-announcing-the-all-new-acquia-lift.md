Today, [we released a new version of Acquia Lift](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-unveils-faster-easier-personalization-marketers), our web personalization tool.

In today's world, personalization has become central to the most successful customer experiences. Most organizations know that personalization is no longer optional, but have put it off because it can be too difficult. The new [Acquia Lift](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift) solves that problem.

While before, Acquia Lift may have taken a degree of fine-tuning from a developer, the new version simplifies how marketers create and launch website personalization. With the new version, anyone can point, click and personalize content without any code.

We started working on the new version of Acquia Lift in early 2018, well over a year ago. In the process we interviewed over 50 customers, redesigned the user interface and workflows, and added various new capabilities to make it easier for marketers to run website personalization campaigns. And today, at our European customer conference, Acquia Engage London, we released the new [Acquia Lift](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift) to the public.

You can see all of the new features in action in this [5-minute Acquia Lift demo video](https://youtu.be/I9LSCq_9zVw):

The new Acquia Lift offers the best web personalization solution in Acquia's history, and definitely the best tool for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
