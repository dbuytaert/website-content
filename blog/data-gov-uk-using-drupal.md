Web founder [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) and [Professor Nigel Shadbolt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Shadbolt) unveiled [Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) today. The new website offers public sector data, ranging from traffic statistics to crime figures, for private or commercial use. It is designed to be similar to the [Obama administration's data.gov project](http://data.gov), run by Vivek Kundra, Chief Information Officer in the US.

What is exciting is that [Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/) uses both [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and various semantic web technologies to encourage people to create data mashups and to visualize the data in clear, imaginative ways that provide more insight in the underlying information. It is great to see that [Open Source, Open Data and government meet](https://dri.es/where-open-source-open-data-and-government-meet), and it is great validation for [Drupal's adoption of the semantic web](https://dri.es/tag/semantic-web). *Hot stuff!*
