# Disney using Drupal

The Walt Disney Company is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for the [ABC Family community website](http://community.abcfamily.go.com). ABC Family is a cable television network that they currently own. In 2002, Disney acquired the network from News Corp for $3.2 billion USD.
