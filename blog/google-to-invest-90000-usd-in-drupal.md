The summer is off to a great start again. Google just announced that they will [sponsor 18 Drupal developer stipends](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/drupal) in this year's [Summer of Code program](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009) (SoC). Google provides a stipend of 5,000 USD to each student developer, of which 4,500 USD goes to the student and 500 USD goes to [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) (or to the mentors). With 18 accepted applications this adds up to a 90,000 USD investment over a three-month period. In addition to Drupal, they are supporting a [ton of other Open Source projects](http://socghop.appspot.com/program/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2009), including [PHP](http://socghop.appspot.com/org/home/google/gsoc2009/php), which Drupal heavily depends on.

The accepted students, their projects, and the mentors are listed on the [official Drupal.org announcement](https://www.drupal.org/node/440838). Congratulations to all successful applicants, and thanks to the Drupal Summer of Code organizers, the Drupal mentors, and last but not least, Google. *Awesome!*
