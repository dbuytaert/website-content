[video 6PMxpdPLm-k]

It's been a while since I wrote about one of [my favorite songs](https://dri.es/tag/favorite-music), but Counting Crows' "Round Here" is one that has always stuck with me.

I've listened to this song hundreds of times, and [this non-standard version](https://youtu.be/6PMxpdPLm-k), where Adam Duritz stretches the lyrics and lets his emotions flow, hits even harder.

To me, it feels like a quiet cry about mental health. About someone feeling disconnected, uncertain of who they are, and not at home in their own life. There is something raw, honest, and deeply human in the way the song captures that struggle.

The song has only grown on me over time. I didn't fully understand or appreciate it in my twenties, but now that I'm in my forties, I've come to see more people around me carrying quiet struggles. If that is you, I hope you're taking care of yourself.
