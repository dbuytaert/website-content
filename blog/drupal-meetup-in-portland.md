I'll be in Portland next week for [OOPSLA](http://oopsla.org/) (see [previous post](https://dri.es/javana)). I have some time of in the evening, so [Boris Mann](https://www.bmannconsulting.com/) of [Bryght](http://bryght.com/) is organizing a [Drupal meetup on Tuesday evening](https://groups.drupal.org/node/1657). I'm also meeting with [Scott Kveton](https://kveton.com/blog/) of [JanRain](https://www.janrain.com/) to talk some more about [OpenID](https://openid.net/). Last time I met Scott, he was still Associate Director at the [OSU Open Source Labs](https://osuosl.org/), the organization that [hosts the Drupal infrastructure](https://dri.es/drupal-loves-the-osl). Should be fun and interesting so feel free to join.
