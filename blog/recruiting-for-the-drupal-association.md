The [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) is a non-profit organization dedicated to help the Drupal community with fun­ding, infra­structure, events, promotion and distribution.

Since [we launched the Drupal Association in January 2007](https://dri.es/drupal-association-launched), roughly 9 months ago, we (i) improved the drupal.org infrastructure, (ii) we helped organize two international Drupal conferences, (iii) we established a relation with an accounting firm, (iv) we funded Drupal's presence at [FrOSCon](https://www.froscon.org/), (v) we started setting up fundraising campaigns and partnerships, (vi) we are close to launching a Drupal Association membership model, etc.

By January 2008 we have to elect our second Board of Directors, and so I figured this would be a good time to start soliciting for candidates and nominations. Despite the progress that we have made in 2007, we would like to ramp up our professionalism and activities in 2008.

We are looking for people that want to become a board member, and that can provide leadership and experience to expand the reach of the Drupal Association and its activities. Specifically, we are interested in people who can provide leadership in the following areas:

- Legal issues
- Marketing
- Communication
- Event coordination
- Local user group coordination
- Drupal.org (redesign) coordination
- Changing the world
- ...

Currently, the Drupal Assocation is solely run by unpaid volunteers and we expect that our board members spend up to four hours/week working on their Drupal Association responsibilities and obligations. In other words, we are looking for people that are committed to help support and drive Drupal's explosive growth.

If you think you might be a good candidate, or if you want to nominate someone other than yourself, please let me know in the comments. I'll make sure to loop you in as soon we worked out the official nomination and election process/timeline.
