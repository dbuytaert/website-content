# Commercial Drupal training

[Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/), one of the available [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) vendors, recently started to provide [commercial Drupal training](https://www.lullabot.com/training).

If we want Drupal to grow, it has to make inroads in the commercial market. For that to happen, we need a certain level of support that is currently not available. Commercial training is part of that.

So while I applaud Lullabot for providing commercial Drupal training, some members of the Drupal community expressed concerns that making profit of what is a collaborative work is a questionable business practice that shouldn't be promoted. Of course, people can believe what they want, and I don't want to come across as self-righteous, but I think that such people need to be whacked with a foam cluestick. Repeatedly.

A couple months ago, I wrote about the fact that [Drupal needs more mentors](/drupal-mentors-needed). Well, the Lullabot team dived head first into the mentor role. Through their [audiocasts and videocasts](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts), and now by means of commercial Drupal training, they help people get on board. And them getting paid for doing what they enjoy doing most, and what is necessary for the Drupal community at large, is simply great. Rock on, Lullabot!
