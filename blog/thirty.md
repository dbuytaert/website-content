# Thirty

When I was 20, my favorite quote was: *"Flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss" (Douglas Adams)*.

Today, I turn 30, and while I'm still new to this whole thirties thing, so far I continue to really like that quote: let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable, let's continue to learn, and let's not take ourselves too serious.

With that in mind, let's end my twenties in style ...
