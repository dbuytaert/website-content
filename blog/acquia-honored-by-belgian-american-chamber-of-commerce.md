My company [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) was honored this week by [BelCham](http://belcham.org), the Belgian-American Chamber of Commerce, as the "Company of the Year". I'm proud of this honor, which speaks to the great work that our team of more than 500 Acquians from around the globe do for our customers everyday.

BelCham is an organization dedicated to helping Belgian entrepreneurs navigate the complexities of Belgian-American trade. Companies like Acquia, InBev, Brussels Airlines, and restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien support BelCham's work.

If you want to build a big company, then at some point you have scale globally. Scaling a business globally is challenging. I try to give back some of my experience by advising Belgian entrepreneurs that want to move or expand to the US. I often recommend they get in touch with BelCham because they can help entrepreneurs find the resources they need to extend their network and grow globally.
