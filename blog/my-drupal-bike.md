# My Drupal bike

Through the wonderful [Neil Drumm](https://dri.es/neil-drumm), [Chapter Three](http://www.chapterthree.com) learned that I was in the market for a bicycle. Chapter Three – the company of Drupal overlords Matt Cheney, Josh Koenig and Zack Rosen – has a fun side project called [Mission Bicycles](https://www.missionbicycle.com) that uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) to sell customizable [fixed gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle) and [single speed bikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-speed_bicycle) in San Francisco.

Of course, I was interested in riding around on one of their customized bicycles. Especially one that featured a white seat, white rims, and a particularly familiar shade of blue (#027AC6) for the frame. On top of that, I was promised that, if I wasn't already, I would be the coolest kid on my block. They'd toss in a free Drupal bike jersey to help guarantee the promised result.

I ordered one instantly, and a couple of weeks later, a bike showed up at my front door. After assembling the bike, the tubes still filled with San Francisco air, I'm now ready to ride the European lands in true California style.
