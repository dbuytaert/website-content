# State of Drupal 2007 survey

Each [Drupalcon](http://drupalcon.org), I try to provide a *State of Drupal presentation* to communicate our current [Zeitgeist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist) and to share my ideas about what I think is important for Drupal. Next month's [DrupalCon Barcelona](http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/) is no exception.

This time around, I'd like to do something slightly different, and incorporate direct feedback from all Drupal users, contributors, developers, evaluators, and everyone else who has an interest in Drupal's future.

Whether you are a long-term Drupal developer or a recently joined new person to the Drupal community, I'd like to invite you to take part in the [State of Drupal 2007 survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=exg2izKcY4WouOy73JoZUw_3d_3d) that I created. The goal of the survey is to better understand our needs, and to help prioritize our efforts. If you can't attend DrupalCon Barcelona, don't worry; I'll make sure to share the results after the conference.
