Next Thursday, I'll be spreading the Drupal love at the [CMS Congres in Brussels](http://www.cms-channel.be/index.php?id=275). Feel free to join if you don't have plans already. Should be interesting as many of the big commercial CMS vendors will be present. Let's figure out how they look at Open Source, and whether they agree with the fact that Open Source offers better value proposition for users (customers). They probably just laugh in the face of danger.
