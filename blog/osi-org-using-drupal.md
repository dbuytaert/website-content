# OSI using Drupal

The [Open Source Initiative (OSI)](https://opensource.org/) is using Drupal for their official website at [http://opensource.org](https://opensource.org/).

[Danese Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danese_Cooper) recently [announced the redesign](https://opensource.org/node/127) at the [OSI board blog](https://opensource.org/blog). [Eric Raymond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Raymond), former president of the Open Source Initiative and author of the [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/) is blogging there as well.
