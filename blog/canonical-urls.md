[Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/) showed me that I have some duplicate content issues on <https://dri.es>, so I went ahead and tweaked my use of the `rel="canonical"` link tag.

When you have content that is accessible under multiple URLs, or even on multiple websites, and you don't explicitly tell Google which URL is *canonical*, Google makes the choice for you. By using the `rel="canonical"` link tag, you can tell Google which version should be prioritized in search results.

Doing canonicalization well improves your site's SEO, and [doing canonicalization wrong can be catastrophic](https://moz.com/blog/catastrophic-canonicalization). Let's hope I did it right!
