# Studio Brussel using Drupal

Studio Brussel (StuBru), without a doubt Belgium's best radio station, relaunched [their website](https://stubru.be/) using Drupal today. Check it out at <http://stubru.be>!

The concept and design work was done by [i-merge](http://www.i-merge.net/). The implementation was done in-house by StuBru's producer, the [VRT](https://www.vrt.be/).
