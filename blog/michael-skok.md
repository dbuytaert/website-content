Some of you picked up that [Michael Skok is leaving North Bridge](https://gigaom.com/2014/10/30/heiliger-and-skok-exit-north-bridge-venture-partners/), Acquia's lead investor. A number of people asked me if [Michael](http://mjskok.com) is leaving [Acquia's Board of Directors](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/board) as part of that. I'm pleased to say that Michael is staying on as a Director on Acquia's Board.

I first met Michael in the summer of 2007. From the moment I met Michael I knew that he was someone that I could trust and learn from. From the day [we started Acquia](https://dri.es/acquia-my-drupal-startup), we had big dreams – many of which we have realized today. In large part because Michael went all-in and helped us every step of the way. From his operational experience, to his relevant domain expertise, to his passion for Open Source and focus on building great teams and products, Michael has been an incredible asset to our Board. Fast forward 8 years and I'm as excited as ever to work with Michael to realize even bigger dreams with Acquia.
