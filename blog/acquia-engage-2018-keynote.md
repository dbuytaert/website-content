# Acquia Engage 2018 keynote

[image acquia/acquia-engage-2018-airport-billboard]

Last week, Acquia welcomed more than 600 attendees to the fifth annual [Acquia Engage Conference](https://engage.acquia.com/) in Austin, Texas. During my keynote, my team and I talked about Acquia's strategy, recent product developments, and our product roadmap. I also had the opportunity to invite three of our customers on stage – Paychex, NBC Sports, and Wendy's – to hear how each organization is leveraging the Acquia Platform.

All three organizations demonstrate incredible use cases, and I invite you to [watch the recording of the Innovation Showcase](https://youtu.be/1Jkl-bgY4DU) (78 minutes) or [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/acquia-engage-keynote-2018.pdf) (219 MB).

I also plan to share more in-depth blog posts on my conversations with Wendy's, NBC Sports, and Paychex's next week.
