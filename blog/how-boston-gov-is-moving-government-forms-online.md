# How Boston.gov is moving government forms online

Josh Gee, former product manager for the City of Boston's Department of Innovation and Technology, recently shared how [Boston.gov identified 425 PDF forms used by citizens and moved 122 of them online](https://medium.com/@jgee/what-i-learned-in-two-years-of-moving-government-forms-online-1edc4c2aa089). Not only did it improve the accessibility of Boston.gov's government services, it also saved residents roughly 10,000 hours filling out forms. While [Boston.gov is a Drupal website](https://dri.es/city-of-boston-launches-boston-gov-on-drupal), it opted to use [SeamlessDocs](https://seamlessdocs.com) for creating online forms, which could provide inspiration for [Drupal's webform module](https://www.drupal.org/project/webform). Josh's blog provides an interesting view into what it takes for a government to go paperless and build constituent-centric experiences.
