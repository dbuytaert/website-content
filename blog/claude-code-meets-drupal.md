# Claude Code meets Drupal

Can AI actually help with real Drupal development? I wanted to find out.

This morning, I fired up Claude Code and pointed it at my personal Drupal site. In a 30-minute session, I asked it to help me build new features and modernize some of my code. I expected mixed results but was surprised by how useful it proved to be.

I didn't touch my IDE once or write a single line of code myself. Claude handled everything from creating a custom Drush command to refactoring constructors and converting Drupal annotations to PHP attributes.

If you're curious what AI-assisted Drupal development actually feels like, this video captures the experience.
