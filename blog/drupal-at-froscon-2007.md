# Drupal at FrOSCon 2007

[FrOSCon](http://froscon.de) is a two day conference on Free Software and Open Source, taking place on August 25th and 26th at the Fachhochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in Sankt Augustin near [the city of Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn) in Germany.

With the help of the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association), [Robert Douglass](http://www.robshouse.net/) is organizing a [strong Drupal presence](https://www.froscon.de/Read-News.5+M5e40f19e75a.0.html?&L=1): we booked two rooms for a dedicated two day Drupal track (at least 12 Drupal presentations), we'll bring in Drupal experts like [Gerhard Killesreiter](https://dri.es/gerhard-killesreiter) (core committer), [Gábor Hojtsy](https://dri.es/gabor-hojtsy) (core committer) and [Robert Douglass](http://www.robshouse.net) ([Drupal book author](https://dri.es/apress-drupal-book) and [Lullabot employee](https://lullabot.com)) himself, as well as several [Google Summer of Code students](https://dri.es/google-to-invest-100000-usd-in-drupal).

We still have some slots left for Drupal speakers, so make sure to get in touch with Robert if you want to present about Drupal. The deadline to submit your session proposals is July 1st. We're fully committed to make this a great Drupal event so people giving a Drupal presentation will have their hotel room paid for by the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association)!

*Good job, Robert!*
