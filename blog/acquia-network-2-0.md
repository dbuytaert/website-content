We just re-launched the [Acquia Network](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-network) with a new look and feel, powerful new services and a new developer-focused subscription. Peter Guagenti, who has championed the effort within Acquia, has all the details in [his announcement blog post](https://www.acquia.com/blog/rebooting-acquia-network-new-tools-services-same-commitment-customers). The Acquia Network is near and dear to my heart as it has been [the core of our offerings](https://dri.es/acquia-out-of-beta) since the founding of the company and is a key element for [Acquia's product vision](https://dri.es/acquia-product-strategy-and-vision).

We're living in an interesting time; the web is becoming more and more complex, and on top of that, people's expectations of your website are also increasing. Think about it. Five years ago, it was as simple as adding a blog feature to your site to leap-frog your competition, but today that is just not good enough. You likely need a mobile version of your site, blazing fast response times, carefully tuned content, and much more. It is more subtle, more difficult and more work than it ever was before. Going at it alone can be tough.

The idea behind the Acquia Network has always been to give developers and site owners the best possible tools to help them keep up with the growing complexity of building a great web experience. The new and rebooted Acquia Network makes that promise even stronger as we added three new tools to help build better web experiences: [New Relic](http://newrelic.com) (performance monitoring), [Mobify](http://mobify.com) (mobile) and [Visual Website Optimizer](https://vwo.com/) (A/B testing). There is more that can be done, so expect the Acquia Network to evolve and grow quite a bit in the weeks ahead. More details in [Peter's announcement blog post](https://www.acquia.com/blog/rebooting-acquia-network-new-tools-services-same-commitment-customers).
