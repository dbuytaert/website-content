Next weekend, on Saturday June 27, the French-speaking Drupal community in Belgium is organizing Belgium's very first DrupalCamp. The event takes place in Louvain-la-Neuve which makes it pretty accessible for both Dutch and French-speaking Belgians. Details are available on <http://drupalfr.be>. Due to the work of [Gilles Bailleux](https://bailleux.be/), the event got some great press in this weekend's edition of the Belgian newspaper, La Libre Belgique. Both a screenshot and a PDF are provided below.

It's always great to meet Drupal people, so I currently plan to go to [Utrecht on Friday](https://dri.es/drupal-7-usability-code-sprint-in-the-netherlands), to Louvain-la-Neuve on Saturday, and back to Utrecht on Sunday to help with the [Drupal 7 usability code sprint](https://dri.es/drupal-7-usability-code-sprint-in-the-netherlands). It's just great to see so many community events being organized – we've gotten to a point where there are often Drupal events happening at the same time in different places in the world.
