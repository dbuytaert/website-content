And the answer to yesterday's ["Eye grow Drupal" question](https://dri.es/eye-grow-drupal) is: *Druplipets*. Hundreds of cute little Druplipets, your friendly Druplicon chia pet. Druplipet is the newest member of the [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Drupal Gardens](http://drupalgardens.com) family and will be making appearances at industry events this year. It is making its first appearance at [SXSW](http://sxsw.com) along with [a fun contest](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/join-search-acquia%E2%80%99s-druplipet-and-tweet-your-most-creative-picture). Needless to say, Drupal chia pets are fun and powerful stuff!
