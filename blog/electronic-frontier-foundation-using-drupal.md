# Electronic Frontier Foundation using Drupal

The main website of the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) (EFF) relaunched using Drupal. The EFF is a non-profit organization with the stated purpose of being dedicated to preserving free speech rights.

According to [Tim Jones](http://toneland.net), who helped with the implementation, the most interesting bit is the file-management. The EFF has thousands of PDFs spanning 15 years of legal cases to archive and organize. In the old site, these were just flat HTML links, so a big reason for the move to Drupal was to build a document management system. You can see it best on document-heavy pages like [the AT&amp;T case](https://www.eff.org/cases/att).
