On May 20, [Peter Forret](https://blog.forret.com/) is hosting the first Belgian Barcamp: [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrusselsForTheImpatient). A [Barcamp](http://barcamp.org/) is an *ad-hoc un-conference driven by its attendees*. It is free and open for everyone but it has no visitors, only participants. Attendees must give a demo, a presentation, or help with one. It has no fixed agenda either. Things just happen, and in happening, cause other things to happen.

I attended two Barcamps so far and both have been a blast. That said, I might prepare two sessions for Barcamp Brussels:

1. A brief presentation on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).
2. A discussion on photoblogging software.

After talking to [Pieter Baert](https://www.pieterbaert.be/) (co-founder of [drieduizend.be](https://drieduizend.be/)) and [Ine Dehandschutter](http://www.monuments.nu/) (co-founder of [photoblog.net](http://www.photoblog.net/) and official photographer of Belgian prime minister [Guy Verhofstadt](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Verhofstadt)), I'd like to figure out what the ideal photoblogging software looks like. Being relatively new to photography and photoblogging, I'd like to meet other photographers at Barcamp to share how they (want to) manage their photos on their websites.
