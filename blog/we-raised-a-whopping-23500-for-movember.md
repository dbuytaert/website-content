# We raised a whopping $23,500 for Movember

[Movember](http://movember.com) has come to an end, and soon I will remove the moustache that I groomed so carefully during the month of November. Before I shave, though, I want to thank everyone who sponsored my moustache.

The Acquia team, of which I am a part, [raised a whopping $23,500 USD](https://www.acquia.com/blog/movember-and-power-community), and donations are still coming in. That puts us in the top 25 teams nationally. When we first started talking about doing a Movember campaign at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), no one would have thought we'd have the impact that we did since we conducted the program with a relatively small team. I continue to be amazed by what this team can do when we put our minds together to achieve something.

Myself, I raised a total of $699 for the team. When I wrote [my Movember announcement post](https://dri.es/movember-2010), I jokingly said that I'd humiliate myself publicly by posting pictures when I raised more than $500. While some people gave me money not to post any pictures, or to shave prematurely, I still owe it to many others to show the result of my mo' growing efforts. Pictures or it didn't happen.

Of course, the real "thank you" should go to the many people that donated money to our cause. Thanks to them a significant amount of money will go to cancer awareness and research. *Thank you!*
