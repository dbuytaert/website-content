# Happy nineteenth birthday, Drupal

[image drupal/happy-nineteenth-birthday]

Nineteen years ago today, I released Drupal 1.0.0. Every day, for the past nineteen years, the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/) has collaborated on providing the world with an Open Source CMS and making a difference on how the web is built and run.

It's easy to forget that software is written one line of code at the time. And that adoption is driven one website at the time. I look back on nearly two decades of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and I'm incredibly proud of our community, and how we've contributed to a more open, independent internet.

Today, many of us in the Drupal community are working towards [the launch of Drupal 9](https://dri.es/plan-for-drupal-9). Major releases of Drupal only happen every 3-5 years. They are an opportunity to bring our community together, create something meaningful, and celebrate our collective work. But more importantly, major releases are our best opportunity to re-engage past users and attract new users, explaining why Drupal is better than closed CMS platforms.

As we mark Drupal's 19th year, let's all work together on a successful launch of Drupal 9 in 2020, including a wide-spread marketing strategy. It's the best birthday present we can give to Drupal.
