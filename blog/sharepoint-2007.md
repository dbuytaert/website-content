Bert Boerland [predicts](http://willy.boerland.com/myblog/community_management_system): *Within 3 years the acronym "CMS" won't mean "Content Management System" anymore but will be redefined to "Community Management System".*

Markets are more likely to fragment than to consolidate so I think both will co-exist and inevitably overlap. That said, I agree with the notion that community software will continue to emerge and that [content isn't king](https://dri.es/content-is-not-king). And to contribute to the disorderly jumble that is the CMS acronym, may I suggest a third term: *Collaboration Management System*. It might be a better match.

Especially the introduction of [SharePoint 2007](http://office.microsoft.com/sharepoint/) might have significant impact on this particular market. SharePoint 2007 adds features like forums, blogs, wikis, RSS feeds, news aggregation, surveys, issue tracking ... but also [install profiles](https://dri.es/drupal-distributions) and [custom content types](https://dri.es/custom-content-types). Clearly, Microsoft decided to play catch up. And rumor has it that the improved integration with Microsoft Office and Microsoft Outlook is jaw-dropping.

Drupal's document management functionality and integration with tools like Microsoft Office and OpenOffice is severely lacking. As it stands, Drupal is **not** a good SharePoint alternative, yet there is quite a bit of overlap in terms of functionality. It sure makes for an interesting situation.

I wonder what impact the introduction of SharePoint 2007 will have. What was once an important Drupal differentiator (i.e. bundling a wide variety of functionality into a single platform) will finally become commodity in 2007. Instead, seamless integration with other applications might become essential to compete? *Interesting times!*
