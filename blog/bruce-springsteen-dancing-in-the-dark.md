[video 129kuDCQtHs]

Ah, The Boss. The line *"You can't start a fire without a spark"* from [Dancing in the dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSGhuT_gCk) is one of the most important sentences in my life. The best things in life come from passion. I enjoy nothing more than watching passion, as well as helping to create and direct passion. That is why I like this video so much – not only do the lyrics nail it, Bruce's performance is also living proof of it.

I only saw Bruce Springsteen once. A number of years ago my dad took me to a Bruce Springsteen concert – it's been the only rock concert I've ever been to with my dad, making it a special experience on its own. The concert itself was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen – the level of sustained energy and joy was simply incredible.

For all these reasons, watching the video above makes me start my day with a smile. I'm one lucky bastard.
