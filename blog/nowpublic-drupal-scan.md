# NowPublic Drupal Scan

[NowPublic](http://nowpublic.com) launched an interesting new feature called *Scan*. First, they aggregate data from sites like [Twitter](https://twitter.com), [identi.ca](https://identi.ca/) and [Pownce](https://pownce.com) in near real-time. Then they aggregate the information, filter it by keywords, geo-locate it, and conveniently present it on a dashboard. Like that, you can see what is happening in different places around the world.

Being [the sucker for statistics that I am](https://dri.es/tag/statistics), I asked Michael Meyers (CTO, NowPublic) to setup a special [NowPublic Drupal Channel](http://www.nowpublic.com/tags/drupal) so that we can have our very own [NowPublic Drupal Scan](http://www.nowpublic.com/tags/drupal/scan). Michael did, so check out the *Drupal Scan* at <http://www.nowpublic.com/tags/drupal/scan>. It is a great showcase of what can be done with activity streams or lifestreams, and with Twitter data specifically. *What is not to like?*
