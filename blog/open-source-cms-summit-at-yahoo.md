At the [Drupal road trip to San Francisco](https://dri.es/drupal-road-trip-san-francisco) last summer, we met some great people at [Yahoo!](https://www.yahoo.com/). With their generous help, we're now throwing a party ...

The [Open Source CMS Summit](http://oscms-summit.org/) is a two-day conference for those interested in open source content management systems. It is open to all open source content management systems and free for everyone to attend. The conference will take place on March 22nd and 23rd at the Yahoo! campus, in the heart of California's Silicon Valley.

We'd like to invite all open source CMS projects to take part, to help spread the word, and to submit session proposals at <http://2007.oscms-summit.org/>. *Let's party together!*
