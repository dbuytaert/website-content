# Drupal hooks vs Drupal events

Jonathan Daggerhart wrote [a fantastic tutorial on Drupal 8's events system](https://www.daggerhart.com/drupal-8-hooks-events-event-subscribers/). I especially liked the comparison to Drupal's traditional hook system. When reading Jonathan's tutorial, I couldn't help but think how useful it would be to integrate it into [Drupal's official documentation](https://www.drupal.org/documentation).
