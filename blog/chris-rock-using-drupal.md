# Chris Rock using Drupal

A lot of the recent "scores" I've listed on this site have been from serious institutions: [ING](https://dri.es/ing-using-drupal), [Investor.gov](https://dri.es/investor-gov-using-drupal), [The U.S. Small Business Administration](https://dri.es/sba-gov-using-drupal), and [The World Economic Forum](https://dri.es/world-leaders-using-drupal).

But don't think for a moment that Drupal's losing any ground in other areas. I was in NYC recently, the mecca of the media and entertainment industry, and Drupal is about to get really big there – that's food for another blog post that I'm planning to write.

In the entertainment industry, comedian [Chris Rock](http://chrisrock.com) recently moved his website to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Acquia Dev Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-dev-cloud) with the help of [SuperStar Media](http://superstarmedia.com). We have a post with more details on the [Acquia.com blog](https://www.acquia.com/blog) at <https://www.acquia.com/blog/acquia-dev-cloud-rocks>.
