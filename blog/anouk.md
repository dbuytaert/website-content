Another post in [my favorite music category](https://dri.es/tag/favorite-music): Anouk, a Dutch singer.

Between 1998 and 2008, Anouk left The Netherlands and moved to US to escape the pressures of fame, only to return a few years later.

I embedded two of my favorite songs in this blog post. The first song (*Nobody's wife*) was recorded in 1998 before she left, the second song (*Michel*) ten years later in 2008 after she had returned from the US. In the first song, she is getting eggs smashed at her t-shirt and simply takes of her t-shirt to continue in her bra. In the second song, she performs live in front of 60.000 people, and is visibly more relax.

I've been a big fan of Anouk from day one, for more than 10 years, and still think she is one of the best European singers.
