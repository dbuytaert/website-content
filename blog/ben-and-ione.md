# Ben and Ione

[image winchester-2011/ben-and-ione]

We had a fun and jam-packed Fourth of July weekend with Ben and Ione. They are some of our best friends from Belgium, and they'll be living in Boston for two months. Should be a lot of fun. Ben and I go back a long time; among other things we started [Mollom](https://mollom.com) together.
