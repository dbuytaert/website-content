Do you have questions about the upcoming Drupal 8 release? On Thursday, September 26 at [DrupalCon Prague](https://prague2013.drupal.org/), I'll be moderating a [question-and-answer core conversation](https://prague2013.drupal.org/session/drupal-8-leadership-qa) with a panel of Drupal 8 leaders, including core committers and initiative leads. Questions are [submitted in advance online](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nV-QECHLi1ZXhQAvHnXioC0fmBHFH7bzoOKJKVGBoD8/viewform), and anyone can submit a question. I will curate the submissions to ask the panel the most interesting and relevant questions. We'll also publish the full list of submissions after DrupalCon (with personal information removed) so that the community has a chance to get answers for questions we don't have time for during the session.

This is a rare opportunity for the community to communicate directly with the decision-makers who are shaping Drupal 8 into the best release of Drupal yet. Help us make the most of of it – [submit your questions now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1nV-QECHLi1ZXhQAvHnXioC0fmBHFH7bzoOKJKVGBoD8/viewform)!
