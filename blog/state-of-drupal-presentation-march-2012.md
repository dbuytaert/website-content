Last week at DrupalCon Denver, I gave my traditional state of Drupal presentation. A total of 3000 were present at DrupalCon. A lot of people asked me for my slides. So in good tradition, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-march-2012.pdf) (PDF, 21 MB) or you can [watch a video recording of my keynote](https://youtu.be/RddJvlbSY88).
