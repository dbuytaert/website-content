# Radiohead - Creep

I've loved this song since I was 15 years old, so after 25 years it definitely deserves a place in [my favorite music list](https://dri.es/tag/favorite-music). When I watched this recording, I stopped breathing for a while. Beautifully devastating. Don't mix this song with alcohol.
