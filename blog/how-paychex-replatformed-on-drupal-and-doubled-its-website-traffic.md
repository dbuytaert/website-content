# How Paychex replatformed on Drupal and doubled its website traffic

[image acquia/acquia-engage-2018-interview-with-erica-bizzari]

One trend I've noticed time and time again is that [simplicity wins](https://dri.es/friduction-the-internets-unstoppable-drive-to-eliminate-friction). Today, customers expect every technology they interact with to be both functionally powerful and easy to use.

A great example is Acquia's customer, Paychex. Paychex' digital marketing team recently replatformed [Paychex.com](https://www.paychex.com/) using [Drupal](https://drupal.org/) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/). The driving factor was the need for more simplicity.

They completed the replatforming work in under four months, and beat the original launch goal by a long shot. By leveraging Drupal 8's improved content authoring capabilities, Paychex also made it a lot simpler for the marketing team to publish content, which resulted in doubled year-over-year growth in site traffic and leads.
