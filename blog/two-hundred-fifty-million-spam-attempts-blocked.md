While many of you (in the United States, at least) were out enjoying [4th of July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_%28United_States%29) cookouts over a holiday weekend, our servers at [Mollom](https://mollom.com) remained hard at work. Around 10pm on Sunday evening, while fireworks colored the sky here in the US, Mollom blocked its 250,000,000th piece of spam. The timing couldn't have been better; it's almost as if the fireworks were also for us. ;-)

That is 250 million pieces of content Mollom prevented from cluttering up your sites, and 250 million times we saved administrators all across the web from laborious work in comment moderation queues. If it takes 10 seconds to delete a single spam comment, Mollom has saved site administrators almost 80 years of non-stop work. That has to be worth a few firecrackers at least!
