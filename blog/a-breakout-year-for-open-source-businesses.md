I was talking to [Chetan Puttagunta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chetanputtagunta/) yesterday, and we both agreed that 2018 has been an incredible year for Open Source businesses so far. (Chetan helped lead [NEA's investment in Acquia](https://dri.es/acquia-raises-50-million-series-f), but is also an investor in Mulesoft, MongoDB and Elastic.)

Between a series of acquisitions and IPOs, Open Source companies have shown incredible financial returns this year. Just look at this year-to-date list:

For me, the success of Open Source companies is not a surprise. In 2016, I explained how [open source crossed the chasm in 2016](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2016), and predicted that proprietary software giants would soon need to incorporate Open Source into their own offerings to remain competitive:

> The FUD-era where proprietary software giants campaigned aggressively against open source and cloud computing by sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt is over. Ironically, those same critics are now scrambling to paint themselves as committed to open source and cloud architectures.

[Adobe's acquisition of Magento](https://dri.es/my-thoughts-on-adobe-buying-magento-for-1-68-billion), [Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub](https://dri.es/how-microsofts-acquisition-of-github-impacts-the-cloud-wars), the $5,2 billion merger of Hortonworks and Cloudera, or SalesForce's acquisition of Mulesoft endorse this prediction. The FUD around Open Source businesses is officially over.
