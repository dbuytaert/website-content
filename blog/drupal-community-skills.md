I asked more than 1,000 Drupal users what they are good at and what skills they'd like to invest in. The results are provided below, and might be of interest for [upcoming Drupal book authors](https://dri.es/wanted-drupal-book-authors), the Drupal documentation team, or those of us who want to flatten the [Drupal learning curve](https://dri.es/drupal-learning-curve).
