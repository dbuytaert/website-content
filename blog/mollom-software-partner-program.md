One of [Mollom](https://mollom.com)'s main goals is to give you time to focus on your site, rather than fighting spam. We also don't want you to spend time worrying about your Mollom plugin. One way we prevent that is by finding high-quality companies who focus on specific content management systems, and partnering with them to provide world-class products and services. We agree to vet the quality of the product, they agree to commit substantial resources for development, maintenance, and support, and together we deliver a seamless, trouble-free experience.

Our partnerships provide many benefits. By sharing with our partners a percentage of the revenue generated by each of their Mollom Plus subscribers, and featuring their plugins, products, or services within their respective platforms, our partners benefit. By having a stable, high-quality set of plugins available for popular systems, we benefit. Through access to these well-managed and supported products and services, you benefit.

You can check Mollom's current partners on the [Mollom partners page](https://www.mollom.com/partners). Other projects or vendors interested in offering Mollom to their users through our Software Partner program should [contact us](https://www.mollom.com/contact).
