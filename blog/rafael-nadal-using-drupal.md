# Rafael Nadal using Drupal

Rafael Nadal is currently ranked the number one tennis player in the world, and is regarded by many as one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Last weekend, he won the U.S. Open. Not only does he have a violently torqued topspin forehand, he also has a bad ass content management system for his official website. His official site is serving with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) at <http://www.rafaelnadal.com>. *(Hat tip: [Usamah](https://twitter.com/simsimt))*
