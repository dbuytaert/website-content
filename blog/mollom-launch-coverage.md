# Mollom launch coverage

It is now five days after [Mollom came out of beta](https://dri.es/mollom-out-of-beta) and some of the dust has settled, so I figured I'd give you an update on what people wrote. Here is a selected subset of some of the coverage we got:

- Peter Hagopian at InformationWeek: [Mollom Comment Spam Solution Emerges From Beta](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/09/mollom_comment.html). *Mollom is currently supported by Drupal, WordPress, and Joomla, as well as the recent additions Radiant (a CMS built on the Ruby On Rails framework) and DaliCMS. Mollom seems to be getting better and better and it's nice to see it come out of beta.*
- Mikkel Høgh: [My six months with Mollom](https://mikkel.hoegh.org/blog/2008/my_six_months_with_mollom). *Before Mollom, I've been using spam.module and Akismet with varying degrees of success, and when Mollom first came out, I wondered why we needed another Akismet, but decided to try it out to support Dries. The answer to that question is that Mollom is in fact not just another Akismet. Spam blocking is just one of the things it does. That does not mean that Mollom is not good at blocking spam. My experience is that Mollom is more effective than Akismet and spam.module combined.*
- Growing Venture Solutions: [Mollom - Out of Beta and Ready to Eat Your Spam (without bothering your normal visitors)](http://growingventuresolutions.com/blog/mollom-out-beta-and-ready-eat-your-spam-without-bothering-your-normal-visitors). *The service is now out of Beta and available to large sites that need redundancy and volume analysis for 30 euros/month. That seems like a great deal and they've even got a better deal: most sites with limited needs who are willing to accept occasional server downtime can still get the service for free. Wonderful news.*
- Jan Polzer at Maxiorel: [Mollom: komentářový antispam a zkušenosti z praxe](https://www.maxiorel.cz/mollom-komentarovy-antispam-zkusenosti-z-praxe). (Czech article)
- Justin Miller at Code Sorcery: [Mollom anti-spam service is out of beta](http://codesorcery.net/2008/09/22/mollom-anti-spam-service-is-out-of-beta). *I've been using Mollom for a few months and have been very happy with it. If you run a blog, even one that isn't in Drupal, I would encourage you to check it out. It's free for many uses, so you lose nothing by at least giving it a shot.*
- Josiah Ritchie: [Mollom - The Bullet Proof Vest](http://josiahritchie.com/blog/mollom-bullet-proof-vest). *All this means, the content on the site is pure, not diluted by the evils of this world. Pure, meaningful and trustworthy content means more activity from your visitors. If their experience in pleasant, not inhibited by spam checking devices or spent filtering spam themselves, they are much more likely to return.*
- Robin Wauters at The Next Web: [Mollom drops beta tag in quest to challenge Akismet](http://thenextweb.org/2008/09/22/mollom-drops-beta-tag-in-quest-to-challenge-akismet/). *In the six months that the Belgium-based company has been beta-testing Mollom, they said to have blocked almost 9 million spam messages on thousands of sites.*
- Glenn Paulley at Sybase: [Fighting spam with Mollom](http://iablog.sybase.com/paulley/2008/09/fighting-spam-with-mollom/). *I've been using Mollom (as a beta customer) for several months for one of the websites that I manage and the effectiveness of Mollom's techniques are impressive.*
- Patrick Teglia: [It's Best if You Don't See This](http://patrickteglia.com/blog/its-best-if-you-dont-see). *So, what makes Mollom different, from an end-user's point of view, than the other spam solutions I have tried (Akismet, Spam Karma, etc.)? Nothing, or rather, you have to do nothing, which is a whole lot less than what you do with the others. In fact, you don't have to deal with queues, moderation, constant attention and emails about all of the above. In other words you don't have to do anything. Oh, yeah, and the fact that it just plain works. I have yet to see a spam on my site.*
- Robin Wauters at Tijd.be: [Mollom niet langer in beta, krijgt er een betalend broertje bij](http://tijdblogs.typepad.com/tzine/2008/09/mollom-niet-lan.html). (Dutch article)

Thanks for the positive feedback, and I'm glad you like our service.
