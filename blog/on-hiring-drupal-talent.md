A lot of people have been looking to hire talented Drupal developers but can't seem to find any. I know because every single day, I get e-mails from people asking me if I know any good Drupal developers looking for a job. Alas, I don't, so please stop e-mailing me.

The problem is that the demand for Drupal talent exceeds the supply. As such, most of the Drupal developers I know are maxed out.

So for months, I've been advising people to hire developers with a formal education in computer science and to train them to become Drupal developers. Hire good Java or PHP developers, and let companies like [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/) get them up to speed with Drupal. It strikes me as the winning strategy.

But still, it begs the question: how can we grow the pool of Drupal talent and help Drupal companies scale? But also, how can we raise the bar for Drupal professional services firms?

These are important questions to ask so let's collect some ideas and prioritize them by importance, viability and ease of execution.
