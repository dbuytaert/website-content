The [City of Athens](http://www.cityofathens.gr/) has launched a new [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) site to serve as [its official website](http://www.cityofathens.gr/), along with a Drupal-based site at <http://www.breathtakingathens.com/> that provides visitor and tourism information.

Athens is a large city (3.5 million residents and 6 million tourists each year), with a large tourism base due in part to its role in the 2004 Olympic Games. To support the city's needs, the site includes a large calendar of city events, a comprehensive map-based index of city services and interactive tools that allow citizens to access city resources. The site builds on Drupal's multilingual capabilities to provide information in both Greek and English.
