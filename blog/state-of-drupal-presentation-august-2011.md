Three weeks ago, at DrupalCon London, I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation. In good tradition, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-august-2011.pdf) (PDF, 37 MB) or you can [watch a video recording of my keynote](https://youtu.be/6mK45xCxTI0).

My presentation was based on the results of the [State of Drupal survey](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-2011-survey), which got over 3,000 responses from people all over the world. Because I didn't have time to talk about all the survey questions in my keynote, I've decided to make [a summary of all the survey results](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-summary.pdf) (PDF, 160 KB) available as well. It gives a more complete view on the survey results.

However, there is much more data hidden in the raw survey results, so if you'd like to do your own analysis, you can [download a copy of the raw survey results](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.xls) ([CSV format](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.csv) or [XLS format](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2011-raw.xls)) and look at the raw data yourself. I anonymized the data by removing the name and company information. If you decide to analyze the raw data, consider sharing your findings with all of us.

DrupalCon London was a blast and I would like to thank everyone for making it such a great event.
