# WYSIWYG media embedding in Drupal 8.8 

I'm excited to share that when Drupal 8.8 drops in December, Drupal's WYSIWYG editor will allow media embedding.

You may wonder: <q>Why is that worth announcing on your blog? It's just one new button in my WYSIWYG editor.</q>.

It's a big deal because Drupal's media management has been going through a decade-long transformation. The addition of WYSIWYG integration completes the final milestone. You can read more about it on [Wim's blog post](https://wimleers.com/blog/media-embedding-drupal-8.8).

Drupal 8.8 should ship with complete media management, which is fantastic news for site builders and content authors who have long wanted a simpler way to embed media in Drupal.

Congratulations to the Media Initiative team for this significant achievement!
