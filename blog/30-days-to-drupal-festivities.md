# 30 days to Drupal festivities

In exactly 30 days we'll kick off [DrupalCon Brussels](https://events.drupal.org/). DrupalCon will host over [30 talks and tutorials](https://events.drupal.org/schedule) by outstanding members of the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org/). It is a service for the Drupal community, by the Drupal community, and is open for everyone to join.

Furthermore, I'm speaking at [EuroOSCON](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/euos2006/), we'll have a Drupal booth at EuroOSCON (we're an exhibitor taking part in their "Dot Org Day") and many of us will camp out at [GovCamp Brussels](http://www.govcamp.org/index.php/GovCamp_Brussels) and [BarCamp Brussels](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBrussels).

If you want to join us, make sure to register for each of these events.
