# .NET library for Mollom

Friend of the family, [Jelle Druyts](http://jelle.druyts.net) wrote a [Microsoft .NET library for Mollom](https://www.codeplex.com/mollom). Jelle and I went to the same high school. I've kept up with Jelle over the years and consider him to be on the forefront of everything Microsoft. I've never had the opportunity to work closely with Jelle until more recently, when Jelle offered to contribute a .NET library for [Mollom](https://mollom.com). Jelle's thinking and diligence wowed me – and best of all, he is still the warm and fun human being that he was in high school. Check out [Jelle's announcement](http://jelle.druyts.net/2008/05/18/JustReleasedMollomForNETV10.aspx) for more details. *Thanks, Jelle!*
