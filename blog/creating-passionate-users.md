# Creating passionate users

Like many, I'm a long-time reader of [Creating Passionate Users](https://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/), a blog co-authored by Kathy Sierra. Last month at [Euro OSCON](/drupalcon-brussels) I had the opportunity to attend a 3 hour tutorial by Kathy Sierra, and now I can't wait for the "Creating Passionate Users" book to come out.

I'm a fan.

I'm a fan because over the past year, Kathy has permanently changed my perspective on user experience (and because she managed to put in words what I've known intuitively for a long time). To give you an idea, I've included the blog posts (and graphs) that had the most impact on me.
