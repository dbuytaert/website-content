Every spring, members of Acquia's Product, Engineering and DevOps teams gather at our Boston headquarters for "Build Week". Build Week gives our global team the opportunity to meet face-to-face, to discuss our product strategy and roadmap, to make plans, and to collaborate on projects.

One of the highlights of Build Week is our annual Hackathon; more than 20 teams of 4-8 people are given 48 hours to develop any project of their choosing. There are no restrictions on the technology or solutions that a team can utilize. Projects ranged from an [Amazon Dash Button](https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Buttons/b?ie=UTF8&node=10667898011) that spins up a new Acquia Cloud environment with one click, to a Drupal module that allows users to visually build page layouts, or a proposed security solution that would automate [pen testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) against Drupal sites.

This year's projects were judged on innovation, ship-ability, technical accomplishment and flair. The winning project, Lift HoloDeck, was particularly exciting because it showcases an [ambitious digital experience](https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-digital-experiences) that is possible with Acquia and Drupal today. The Lift Holodeck takes a physical experience and amplifies it with a digital one using [augmented reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality). The team built a mobile application that superimposes product information and smart notifications over real-life objects that are detected on a user's smartphone screen. It enables customers to interact with brands in new ways that [improve a customer's experience](https://dri.es/friduction-the-internets-unstoppable-drive-to-eliminate-friction).

At the hackathon, the Lift HoloDeck Team showed how augmented reality can change how both online and physical storefronts interact with their consumers. In their presentation, they followed a customer, Neil, as he used the mobile application to inform his purchases in a coffee shop and clothing store. When Neil entered his favorite coffee shop, he held up his phone to the posted "deal of the day". The Lift HoloDeck application superimposes nutrition facts, directions on how to order, and product information on top of the beverage. Neil contemplated the nutrition facts before ordering his preferred drink through the Lift HoloDeck application. Shortly after, he received a notification that his order was ready for pick up. Because Acquia Lift is able to track Neil's click and purchase behavior, it is also possible for Acquia Lift to push personalized product information and offerings through the Lift HoloDeck application.

The Lift HoloDeck prototype is exciting because it was built in less than 48 hours and uses technology that is commercially available today. The Lift HoloDeck experience was powered by [Unity](https://unity.com/) (a 3D game engine), [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) (an augmented reality library), [Acquia Lift](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-lift) (a personalization engine) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) as a content store.

The Lift HoloDeck prototype is a great example of how an organization can use Acquia and Drupal to support [new user experiences and distribution platforms](https://dri.es/cross-channel-user-experiences-with-drupal) that engage customers in captivating ways. It's incredible to see our talented teams at Acquia develop such an innovative project in under 48 hours; especially one that could help reshape how customers interact with their favorite brands.

*Congratulations to the entire Lift HoloDeck team; Ted Ottey, Robert Burden, Chris Nagy, Emily Feng, Neil O'Donnell, Stephen Smith, Roderik Muit, Rob Marchetti and Yuan Xie.*
