The summer is off to a great start as Google continues to blow loving kisses at Drupal.

Google just announced that they will [sponsor 21 Drupal developer stipends](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/?csw=12008/drupal/about.html) in this year's [Summer of Code program](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/?csw=1) (SoC). To inspire young developers to work on FOSS projects during the summer, Google will provide a stipend of 5,000 USD to each student developer, of which 4,500 USD goes to the student and 500 USD goes to [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) (or to the mentors). With 21 accepted applications this adds up to a 105,000 USD investment over a three-month period.

The accepted students, their projects, and the mentors are listed on the [official Drupal.org announcement](https://www.drupal.org/node/249455). Many of the listed projects touch Drupal core, so it looks like I'm in for a really busy summer. Congratulations to all successful applicants, and thanks to the Drupal Summer of Code organizers, the Drupal mentors, and last but not least, Google. *Great!*
