Last week was crazy. Six airplanes, three time zones, four different hotels, two rental cars, an Acquia Board meeting, two nights in a tent and ultimately, my mind blown at FooCamp.

[FooCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp) is the annual invitation-only conference organized by [Tim O'Reilly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_O%27Reilly). It is the mother of [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), if you will. The people you get to meet at FooCamp are impressive, and the format (including the nightly campfires) really sets people up to talk, brainstorm and geek out. The result? A fire hose of new ideas and a lot of new friends. *Thanks Tim!*

Just like [last year](https://dri.es/foocamp-was-mindblowing), I was pleasantly surprised by how many of the *Foos* are using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), planning to use Drupal, or even evangelizing Drupal. *More good stuff comin'!*
