Recently, GitHub announced an initiative called [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.blog/2019-05-23-announcing-github-sponsors-a-new-way-to-contribute-to-open-source/) where open source software users can pay contributors for their work directly within GitHub.

There has been quite a bit of debate about whether initiatives like this are good or bad for Open Source.

On the one hand, there is the concern that the commercialization of Open Source [could corrupt Open Source communities](https://dhh.dk/2013/the-perils-of-mixing-open-source-and-money.html), [harm contributors' intrinsic motivation and quest for purpose](https://youtu.be/VBwWbFpkltg) ([blog post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/)), or [could lead to unhealthy corporate control](https://youtu.be/MO8hZlgK5zc) ([blog post](https://github.com/ceejbot/economics-of-package-management/blob/master/essay.md)).

On the other hand, there is the recognition that commercial sponsorship is often a necessary condition for Open Source sustainability. Many communities have found that to support their growth, as a [part of their natural evolution](https://dri.es/the-commercialization-of-a-volunteer-driven-open-source-project), they need to pay developers or embrace corporate sponsors.

Personally, I believe initiatives like GitHub Sponsors, and others like [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/), are a good thing.

It helps not only with the long-term sustainability of Open Source communities, but also improves diversity in Open Source. Underrepresented groups, in particular, don't always have the [privilege of free time](https://dri.es/the-privilege-of-free-time-in-open-source) to contribute to Open Source outside of work hours. Most software developers have to focus on making a living before they can focus on self-actualization. Without funding, Open Source communities risk losing or excluding valuable talent.
