Given the impact of COVID-19 on organizations' budgets, we extended Drupal 7's end-of-life date by one year. Drupal 7 will receive security updates until November 2022, instead of November 2021. For more information, see the [official announcement](https://www.drupal.org/psa-2020-06-24).

Extending the lifetime of Drupal 7 felt like the right thing to do. It's aligned with Drupal's goal to [build software that is safe for everyone to use](https://www.drupal.org/about/values-and-principles).

I wish more software was well-maintained like Drupal is. We released Drupal 7 almost a decade ago and continue to care for it.

We often recognize those who help innovate or introduce new features. But maintaining existing Open Source software also relies on the contributions of individuals and organizations. Today, I'd like us to praise those who maintain and improve Drupal 7. *Thank you!*
