# Flying around the world for fun and Drupal

I have agreed to speak at [Drupal Downunder](http://drupal.org.au/), to be held in Australia on January 22 and 23, 2011. In addition to delivering a presentation, I hope to pick out a 'Crocodile Dundee hat' (minus the croc teeth). It could be a new, alternative look for me.

Given that Australia is pretty much located on the other side of the world, I figure I would use this opportunity to literally fly around the world, making a couple of stops along the way. I'd like to meet more of the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) on this voyage, especially people I haven't met yet or in places where I've not yet visited. I can only pick 2-4 cities to stop but places like Bangkok, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Bejing, Dubai, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Tel Aviv, Mumbai, Moscow and [Munich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1sCDzMUQNk) come to mind. I'm open to other suggestions.

I will book my "around the world ticket" in the next month or two. So, if you are organizing a Drupal Camp or a Drupal meet-up during the last week of January 2011 let me know. I'll see if I can make a stop in your town.
