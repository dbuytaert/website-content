We've got great news to share today; we are announcing that [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) raised $50 million, the largest round of financing we've ever completed.

The round is led by [New Enterprise Associates](http://nea.com) (NEA), one of the world's top investors in our space. They have made various great investments in Open Source (MongoDB, Mulesoft, etc.) as well as SaaS companies (SalesForce, Workday, Box, etc.).

With the new funding, we can continue to go after our vision to help many more organizations with their digital platform and digital business transformation. In addition, Acquia is charting new territory in the world of software with a very unique business model, one that is rooted in Open Source and that helps us build a web that supports openness, innovation and freedom.

We have such a big and exciting opportunity ahead of us. This vision will not come to life on its own and the proprietary competitors are not resting on their laurels. We'll use the funding to double down on all aspects of our company; from increasing our investment in products to deeper investments in sales and marketing.

In addition to lead investor [NEA](http://nea.com), other investors include [Split Rock Partners](http://splitrock.com/), and existing investors [North Bridge Venture Partners](http://www.northbridge.com/), [Sigma Partners](https://www.sigmapartners.com/), [Investor Growth Capital](http://www.investorgrowthcapital.com/), [Tenaya Capital](https://www.tenayacapital.com/), and [Accolade Partners](http://www.accoladepartners.com/). The new funding will bring Acquia's total fund-raising to $118.6 million.

Of course, none of this success would be possible without the support of our customers, the Acquia team, our partners, the Drupal community and our many friends. Thanks so much for supporting Acquia!
