# Mollom for Laconica

[Laconica](http://laconi.ca/), billed as an open-source microblogging tool similar to Twitter or Jaiku, now has its own [Mollom plugin](https://taniwha-nz.livejournal.com/545285.html) to reduce comment and posting spam. Laconica is designed to allow people in a community, company or group to exchange short messages of 140 characters or less, over the web. The Mollom plugin for Laconica is available at https://gitorious.org/laconica-mollom-plugin/mainline/trees/master, and is written in PHP.
