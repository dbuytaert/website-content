Almost every night before bed, I spend time reading. I love the feeling of falling asleep a little wiser than when I woke up. And often I read in the morning too. I read about photography, technology, investing, business, and more.

I love reading anything that provides a "mental workout"; articles or blog posts that stretch my mind or that point me in a different direction, that help me articulate my own emotions and my thoughts, or that make my imagination travel in time and space. Changing minds is changing lives. Reading makes me who I am.

While reading begets more reading, I love writing down my own thoughts as well, and that is what I decided to do this night. *Sleep well!*
