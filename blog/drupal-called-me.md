# Drupal called me

One of the most surprising moments at Drupal Dev Days Leuven? Getting a phone call from [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). Yes, really.

[Marcus Johansson](https://www.drupal.org/u/marcus_johansson) gave me a spontaneous demo of a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com)-powered AI agent built for Drupal, which triggered a phone call right from within the Drupal interface. It was unexpected, fun, and a perfect example of the kind of creative energy in the room.

That moment reminded me why I love Drupal. People were building, sharing, and exploring what Drupal can do next. The energy was contagious.

From [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) modules to AI-powered search, I saw Drupal doing things I wouldn't have imagined two years ago. AI is no longer just an idea. It's already finding its way into Drupal in practical, thoughtful ways.

Outside of doing a Q&amp;A session, I spent much of my time at Drupal Dev Days working on the next phase of Drupal's AI strategy. We have an early lead in AI, but we need to build on it. We will be sharing more on that in the coming month.

In the meantime, huge thanks to the organizers of Drupal Dev Days for making this event happen, and to [Paul Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pdjohnson/) for the fantastic photo. I love that it shows so many happy faces.
