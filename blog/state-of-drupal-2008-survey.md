# State of Drupal 2008 survey

Every year, I try to communicate the "Drupal Zeitgeist" in at least one of my "State of Drupal" presentations. To help me capture the State of Drupal for my presentation at [DrupalCon Szeged](http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/) next month, I'd like to invite you all to take part in the [State of Drupal 2008 survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=KLPwTTG23n_2bNUbygxtOwDg_3d_3d) that I created. The goal of the survey is to better understand our needs and to help prioritize our efforts. If you can't attend DrupalCon Szeged, don't worry; I'll share all results after the conference.

Now, [fill out the survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=KLPwTTG23n_2bNUbygxtOwDg_3d_3d) and help shape the future of Drupal!
