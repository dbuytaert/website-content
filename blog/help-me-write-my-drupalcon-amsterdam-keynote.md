For my DrupalCon Amsterdam keynote, I want to try something slightly different. Instead of coming up with the talk track myself, I want to "crowdsource" it. In other words, I want the wider Drupal community to have direct input on the content of the keynote. I feel this will provide a great opportunity to surface questions and ideas from the people who make [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) what it is.

In the past, I've done traditional surveys to get input for my keynote and I've also done keynotes that were Q&amp;A from beginning to end. This time, I'd like to try something in between.

I'd love your help to identify the topics of interests (e.g. scaling our community, future of the web, information about Drupal's competitors, "headless" Drupal, the Drupal Association, the business of Open Source, sustaining core development, etc). You can make your suggestions in the comments of this blog post or on Twitter (tag them with [@Dries](https://twitter.com/Dries) and [\#driesnote](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=driesnote&src=typd)). I'll handpick some topics from all the suggestions, largely based on popularity but also based on how important and meaty I think the topic is.

Then, in the lead-up to the event, I'll create discussion opportunities on some or all of the topics so we can dive deeper on them together, and surface various opinions and ideas. The result of those deeper conversations will form the basis of my DrupalCon Amsterdam keynote.

So what would you like me to talk about? Suggest your topics in the comments of this blog post or on Twitter by tagging your suggestions with [\#driesnote](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=driesnote&src=typd) and/or [@Dries](https://twitter.com/Dries). *Thank you!*
