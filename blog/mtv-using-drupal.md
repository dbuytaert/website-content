# MTV using Drupal

MTV UK is now using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)! According to the [official press release](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/press_release_lullabot_drupal_and_mtv_uk), the new Drupal-based [MTV UK website](http://www.mtv.co.uk/) will continue to host news and information for their broadcast channels.

The interesting part is the fact that the new website will act as the front-end for [MTV Flux](http://www.mtv.co.uk/mtv), a new social networking website that lets viewers interact with MTV and each other. Angel Gambino, VP Commercial Strategy &amp; Digital Media, MTV Networks UK &amp; Ireland [explains](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/press_release_lullabot_drupal_and_mtv_uk):

<q>Our users now have the ability to create and upload content to mtvflux.co.uk that will also be showcased on the broadcast channel. Drupal's social networking capabilities make it a good match for our local development team's needs and the software's extensibility has allowed the creation of modules to interact with our on-air systems as well as SMS mobile and Flash-based interactive systems.</q>
