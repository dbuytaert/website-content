We hit another milestone today: twenty-thousand sites have been created with [Drupal Gardens](http://drupalgardens.com). It was only two months ago that we hit the [10,000 sites milestone](https://dri.es/10000-drupal-gardens-sites). Who would have thought that we would have doubled that number so quickly? This is really a gratifying moment for us. It means that we're on the right track, building a product that people value highly.

There has also been an increased interest by enterprise customers in Drupal Gardens. It seems to be filling a need for large organizations, as well as creative agencies that want to build and consistently manage many micro-sites, or that want to build them quickly. If you fit that description, I encourage you [to take Drupal Gardens for a spin](http://www.drupalgardens.com/create-site) and to share your feedback with us. We continue to roll out enhancements to Drupal Gardens every three weeks, so your feedback is very important as it influences directly our plans.

I'm proud to have reached this milestone, and would like to thank to all of the Drupal Gardens site owners who have made this possible. While 20,000 sites might sound like a lot, we're just getting started!
