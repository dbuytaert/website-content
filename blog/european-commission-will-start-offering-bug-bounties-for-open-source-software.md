The European Commission made an exciting announcement; it will be [awarding bug bounties to the security teams of Open Source software projects](https://juliareda.eu/2018/12/eu-fossa-bug-bounties/) that the European Commission relies on.

If you are not familiar with the term, a *bug bounty* is a monetary prize awarded to people who discover and correctly report security issues.

[Julia Reda](https://juliareda.eu/) – an internet activist, Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and co-founder of the Free and Open Source Software Audit (FOSSA) project – [wrote the following on her blog](https://juliareda.eu/2018/12/eu-fossa-bug-bounties/):

> Like many other organizations, institutions like the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission build upon Free Software to run their websites and many other things. But the Internet is not only crucial to our economy and our administration, it is the infrastructure that runs our everyday lives.

With over 150 Drupal sites, the European Commission is a big Drupal user, and has a large internal Drupal community. The European Commission set aside 89,000€ (or roughly $100,000 USD) for a Drupal bug bounty. They worked closely with Drupal's Security Team to set this up. To participate in the Drupal bug bounty, read [the guidelines provided by Drupal's Security Team](https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-security-bug-bounty-program-2019).

Over the years I've had many meetings with the European Commission, presented keynotes at some of its events, and more. During that time, I've seen the European Commission evolve from being hesitant about Open Source to recognizing the many benefits that Open Source provides for its key ICT services, to truly embracing Open Source.

In many ways, the European Commission followed classic Open Source adoption patterns; adoption went from being technology-led (bottom-up or grassroots) to policy-led (top-down and institutionalized), and now the EU is an active participant and contributor.

Today, the European Commission is a shining example and role model for how governments and other large organizations can contribute to Open Source (just like [how the White House used to be](https://dri.es/white-house-contributes-to-drupal)).

The European Commission is actually investing in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) in a variety of ways – the bug bounty is just one example of that – but more about that in a future blog post.
