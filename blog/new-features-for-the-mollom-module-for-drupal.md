# New features for the Mollom module for Drupal

We have just released new versions of the [Mollom module for Drupal 6 and Drupal 7](https://www.drupal.org/project/mollom). In addition to various bug fixes, as well as usability and API improvements, we have included two new end-user features. First, we've provided the ability to control the strictness of the text analysis. This allows you to control how aggressively Mollom should show CAPTCHAs and block spam. Second, we ported the profanity checking from the Drupal 7 version of the Mollom module to the Drupal 6 version. This means that you will be able to choose to use Mollom to block obscene language in addition to spam. *Progress!*
