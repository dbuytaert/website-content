As I've written before, I believe analyst reports like the Gartner Magic Quadrant are important because they introduce organizations to Acquia and Drupal. As I've put if before <q>If you want to find a good coffee place, you use Yelp. If you want to find a nice hotel in New York, you use TripAdvisor. Similarly, if a CIO or CMO wants to spend $250,000 or more on enterprise software, they often consult an analyst firm like Gartner.</q>.

You can [read the complete report on Acquia.com](https://www.acquia.com/resources/whitepaper/2019-gartner-magic-quadrant-web-content-management). Thank you to everyone who contributed to this result!

**Update:** Gartner asked me to take down this post, or to update it to follow their citation guidelines. Specifically, Gartner didn't want my commentary clouding their work. I updated this post to remove any personal commentary so my opinion is not blended with their report.
