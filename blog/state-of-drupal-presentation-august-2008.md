# State of Drupal presentation (August 2008)

Last week at [DrupalCon Szeged](https://dri.es/drupalcon-szeged) I gave my traditional state of Drupal presentation. The video of the presentation is provided below, and you can download a [copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-august-2008.pdf) (PDF, 11MB) as well.

The presentation discusses the results of [the recent survey that I conducted](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-2008-survey); the survey ran for 30+ days and collected more than 1300 responses so it should provide a good idea of the community's current thinking. I'll provide more color and details about the survey results in a number of follow-up posts.
