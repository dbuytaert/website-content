As I wrote in [my previous post](https://dri.es/acquia-takes-over-a-subway-station), you might be seeing a lot more of [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) in the coming weeks. If you listen to [NPR](https://www.npr.org/), you may have heard our new radio ads.

Like our [highway billboards](https://dri.es/acquia-highway-billboards) and [train station takeover](https://dri.es/acquia-takes-over-a-subway-station), our NPR campaign is another great opportunity to reach commuters.

NPR is a national non-profit media organization with a network of more than 1,000 affiliated radio stations across the United States – and quite a few use [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) for their sites. It boasts listenership of nearly 30 million, and its airwaves reach nearly [99 percent of Americans](https://www.npr.org/about-npr/693830557/about-npr).

Our NPR ads are running during the morning and evening commutes. In addition, Acquia ads will be featured on the Marketplace Tech podcast, which is popular among technology decision makers. Between the podcasts and radio ads, the potential reach is 64 million impressions.

We have always believed in [doing well by doing good](https://dri.es/do-well-do-good). Sponsoring NPR creates brand awareness for Acquia, but also supports NPR financially. High-quality media organizations are facing incredible challenges today, and underwriting NPR's work is a nice way for Acquia to give back.
