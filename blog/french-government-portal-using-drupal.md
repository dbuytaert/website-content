# French government portal using Drupal

After the [French Ministry for Health, Youth and Sport using Drupal started using](https://dri.es/french-ministry-for-health-youth-and-sport-using-drupal), the French government switched [its official government portal](http://www.gouvernement.fr) to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org)! Check it out at <http://www.gouvernement.fr>. *Impressionnant!*

The site was built by the French Government Multimedia Team and [Adyax Experts](http://www.adyax.com) (an [Acquia partner](https://www.acquia.com/partners)). About 10 persons worked on it for several months. Most of the work was spent on building custom migration tools to switch from SPIP Agora to Drupal.
