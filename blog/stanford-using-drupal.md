I've been around the web long enough to know a good-looking site when I see one – <http://shc.stanford.edu> is a good looking site. It is the home page of the [Stanford Humanities Center](http://shc.stanford.edu), and it uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org).

And there is more. A quick glance at <https://opensource.stanford.edu/knowledgetopics/drupal/sites-using-drupal-stanford> reveals a list of over fifty Drupal sites currently active at Stanford. As far as I saw on the ones I clicked on, each site is different.

This trend isn't specific to Stanford. We see it at MIT, Harvard and [many other universities](https://dri.es/tag/education). More and more universities start to embrace [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). At many of those, Drupal is slowly becoming the de facto platform for web development. It is an emerging trend, and one that introduces a lot of students to Drupal.
