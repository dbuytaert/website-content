About a week ago the new [Pro Drupal Development book](http://drupalbook.com/) started shipping, and today, the book cracked the Amazon Top 100. And we're not talking about the top 100 computer books here, we're talking about *the* top 100 bestsellers.

I'm still waiting for my copy to arrive, and rumor has it that [Apress](https://www.apress.com/), the publisher, already started making arrangements for a reprint.

That ranking might be short-lived but still ... can someone tell me what is going on here, because this is just plain nuts. *I didn't expect that to happen either ...*
