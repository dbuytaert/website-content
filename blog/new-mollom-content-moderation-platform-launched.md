# New Mollom content moderation platform launched

Today I'm excited to announce that we've released the next generation of Mollom - our Content Moderation Platform. For the past five years, we have worked hard to help companies stay ahead of the curve when it comes to content moderation. With today's release, I feel like we've secured our place as the leading enterprise-ready content moderation system.

With over 2 years in development, and 600 beta users, the [new content moderation platform](https://www.mollom.com/moderation) is built to help companies handle extensive amounts of user generated content with ease. The main features of the Content Moderation platform are:

- **Easy team management.** Site admins can add moderators, assign privileges, and monitor how moderators are performing - keeping an eye on productivity while trusting that no malicious content is making it to their site.
- **Fast moderation.** If we know it's spam, your team never sees it. If we're sure it's good content - we'll publish it to your site. For the content we're unsure about - moderators now have a very easy user interface where they can view the contributor, their comment, and their reputation, spam, and profanity score all within seconds. They can approve or decline, and even take bulk actions to speed things up.
- **Custom filters.** The system allows each user to create custom filters so they can focus on a specific subset of commenters. If they only want to see users with low spam and profanity scores - creating a filter takes just a couple seconds and they now have a customized view.
- **Multi-site management.** All customers can have from one to hundreds of sites in their system - which makes moderation for big brands with multiple site properties very easy. Adding a site takes just a couple minutes, and customers can view analytics separately across all site properties.

You can learn more on the [Mollom site](https://www.mollom.com/moderation) or in the [ press release](https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/20/idUSnMKW98547a+1c0+MKW20130320) we issued this morning.

I'm really excited to finally show this off to the world, and continue to help more companies embrace social without fear!
