# Young Global Leader 2013

I was quite surprised when I opened my email to find *"You have been honoured as a Young Global Leader 2013"*.

The [Forum of Young Global Leaders](http://www.weforum.org/communities/young-global-leaders/) is a community formed by the [most exceptional leaders from every region of the world and every stakeholder in society](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_YGL_ActiveMembers.pdf). The Young Global Leaders (YGLs) commit their energy and knowledge to the most critical issues facing humankind.

I feel very privileged to be included in such a diverse, yet cohesive group, that is passionate about shaping the future of the world. As a member of YGLs, I will work with others to initiate, develop and drive solutions on important, globally oriented issues, including health, education, the environment, global governance and security, and development and poverty. The [past initiatives](https://www.weforum.org/content/pages/ygl-initiatives#EstablishedYGLInitiatives) have ranged from freeing hundreds of millions of school-age children from parasitic worms, to a collaborative task force between company cafeterias and NGOs that is providing 23,300 children every day with school meals. Other projects include developing country-wide infrastructure for electric vehicles and sailing a catamaran made out of 12,500 reclaimed plastic bottles halfway round the world to draw attention to marine pollution and climate change.

Being a member will allow me to do of what I'm passionate about; evangelizing the Forum of Young Global Leaders about the benefits of Open Source in their missions, as well as directly putting to work the knowledge I have gained from my experiences with Drupal and Acquia. Can't wait to work with a group of leaders who are committed to "doing well and doing good".
