# Drupal 4.7 released

After more than a year of development [we just released Drupal 4.7.0](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-4.7.0/), our most exciting release to date. More than five years, 13 major releases, 30+ servicing firms employing 100+ Drupal professionals, 300+ third party modules, and over 55,000+ Drupal powered sites later, Drupal 4.7.0 is finally here. Enjoy!
