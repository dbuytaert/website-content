# Movember 2011

It is that time of the year again: [Movember](http://us.movember.com)!

During November each year, Movember is responsible for the sprouting of moustaches on thousands of men's faces around the world. With their Mo's, these men raise vital funds and awareness for men's health, specifically prostate cancer and other cancers that affect men. One in two men will be diagnosed with cancer in his lifetime, and one out of six with prostate cancer.

Like last year, [Acquia's "Mo Drupal"](https://us.movember.com/mospace/676358) team wants your support as we put our faces to work for this great cause. The Acquia team mo'ed its facial hair on November 1st and for about a week now we have practiced the virtues of fine moustachery, immaculate grooming and growing a moustache for [Movember](http://us.movember.com).

For the entire duration of Movember, no hair shall be allowed to grow in the goatee zone - being any facial area below the bottom lip. The complete moustache region, including the entire upper lip and the handlebar zones, will also remain completely shaved. Rest assured, photos will follow!

By growing a moustache, we become walking, talking billboards for the 30 days of November. We raise awareness by prompting private and public conversations about cancer. In addition, we raise funds by [seeking out sponsorship](https://us.movember.com/mospace/726626).

If you'd like, you can [join Acquia's "Mo Drupal" team](https://us.movember.com/mospace/676358) or you can [support me in this cause](https://us.movember.com/mospace/726626).

It's hard to get men to talk about prostate and testicular cancer, yet many of us will be diagnosed with it in our lifetime. The brilliance of Movember lies in its appeal to some basic masculine qualities, such as playing on a team, and competing with others. As a man, it's easier to show your support for such an important cause if you're doing so with a group of other men, all wearing a silly moustache. Give these guys a break and make their efforts worthwhile by supporting us! *Thanks!*
