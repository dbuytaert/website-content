Recently I was interviewed on [RTL Z](https://www.rtlz.nl/), the Dutch business news television network. In the interview, I talk about the growth and success of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), and what is to come for the future of the web. Beware, the interview is in Dutch. If you speak Dutch and are [subscribed to my blog](https://dri.es/subscribe) (hi mom!), feel free to check it out!
