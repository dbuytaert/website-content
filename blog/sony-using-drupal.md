# Sony using Drupal

Sony is using Drupal for [Musicbox](http://musicbox.sonybmg.com/), a site where you can watch all videos in Sony's video library. The site was built by [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/): details are available in [Lullabot's 29th Drupal podcast](https://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/drupal_podcast_no_29_developing_a_drupal_5_site).
