# Adobe Lightroom

Nikon-buddy [Jeff Whatcott](http://jeffwhatcott.com) gave me a quick demonstration of [Adobe Photoshop Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html) when I was in Boston last week. Lightroom was clearly a winner application, so I was pleasantly surprised when Jeff hooked me up with a copy of Lightroom before I returned to Belgium on Friday evening. Although [Jeff works for Acquia now](https://www.acquia.com/press-release-2), he continues to evangelize Adobe's products. ;-)

I spent a couple hours [dabbling with Lightroom](https://dri.es/album/miscellaneous-2008/axl-and-karlijn) this morning, and I'm already in love with it. It is a lot easier than Photoshop CS which I've been struggling to master for years. Lightroom's sidebar widgets and workflow are simple yet powerful, and the non-destructive image editing and the smart saving please the engineer in me. *Thanks Jeff!*
