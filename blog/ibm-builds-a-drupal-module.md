# IBM builds a Drupal module

IBM's Internet Technology Group posted the [sixth article](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource6/index.html) in their series entitled [Using open source software to design, develop, and deploy a collaborative website](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html). In [this article](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource6/index.html), IBM shows you how to create a very simple [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) module to provide announcements on a website.

As mentioned in the Drupal forums: <q>IBM's articles have been a great help; technically speaking as well as to help me 'sell' Drupal to my bosses. IBM backing still goes a long way.</q>
