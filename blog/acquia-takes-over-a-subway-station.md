If you pass through [Kendall Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Square) [MBTA station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Transportation_Authority) in the Boston area, you'll see a station "takeover" starting this week featuring the Acquia brand.

Like our [highway billboards](https://dri.es/acquia-highway-billboards) introduced in December, the goal is for more people to learn about [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) during their commutes. I'm excited about this campaign, because Acquia often feels like a best-kept secret to many.

The Kendall Square station takeover will introduce Acquia to 272,000 daily commuters in one of the biggest innovation districts in the Boston area – and home to the prestigious [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/).

In addition to posters on every wall of the station, the campaign includes Acquia branding on entry turnstiles, 75 digital live boards, and geo-targeted mobile ads that commuters may see while looking at their phones while waiting for the train. It will be hard *not* to be introduced to [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/).

What makes this extra special is that all of the ads feature photographs of actual Acquia employees (*Acquians*, as we call ourselves), which is a nice way to introduce our company to people who may not know us.
