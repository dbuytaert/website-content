I asked more than 1,000 existing Drupal users (not Drupal prospects) what they would like to see improved on [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org). A prioritized wish list is provided below.

We also created a [drupal.org redesign group](https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-org-redesign-analysis): if you are interested in collaborating on a drupal.org redesign or helping with the drupal.org infrastructure, you know where to start. *We have work to do!*
