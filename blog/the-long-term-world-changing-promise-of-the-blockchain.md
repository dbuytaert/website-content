# The long-term, world-changing promise of the blockchain

I enjoyed reading [Vitalik's 2020 endnotes](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html). [Vitalik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin) is one of the founders of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), and one of the most interesting people in the world to follow right now.

Like Vitalik, I'm interested in economic systems, multi-stakeholder coordination, and [public good governance and sustainability](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source). How do we create Open Source communities that will thrive for *hundreds* of years to come? How do we make sure the Open Web is still thriving in a *thousand* years? These are some of the questions I think about.

While I think about these things, Vitalik is making it happen. The blockchain world is experimenting with new funding models (e.g. [ICOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering), [DAICOs](https://ethresear.ch/t/explanation-of-daicos/465) or [quadratic funding](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)), decision-making models (e.g. [quadratic voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html)), organizational models (e.g. [DAOs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)), and architectural innovation (e.g. [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) or [Blockstack](https://www.blockstack.org/)).

The [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) allows these concepts to be implemented in a robust and secure way. Eventually, they could be used to help sustain and govern public goods like Open Source projects and the Open Web.

But it's not just Open Source or the Open Web that should be considered. Some of the very biggest problems in the world (for example, climate change) are multi-stakeholder problems that require better funding, coordination and decision-making models too.

So, yes, these are important developments to pay attention to!
