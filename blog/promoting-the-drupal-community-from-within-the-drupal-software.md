Jacob Rockowitz recently posted a blog post with [ideas about how we can make Drupal more welcoming](https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/content-first-technology-second).

What I found most interesting about Jacob's blog post is that he makes the point that every WordPress site (not WordPress.org) has an 'About WordPress' section in the administration backend that shows both WordPress' values and contributor credits.

This could be an interesting approach for Drupal and is an idea worth exploring. Today, [Drupal's values and principles](https://dri.es/defining-drupal-values-and-principles) and [Drupal's contribution credits](https://dri.es/who-sponsors-drupal-development-2017) live on Drupal.org, but not in the Drupal software itself. When done well, it's probably one of the most impactful ways to educate people and organizations that are new to Drupal about our community and open source. And by having credits in the software, we'd inspire more people and organizations to contribute back. It's an interesting idea.
