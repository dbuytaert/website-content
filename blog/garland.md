We both know that the most important impression you need to make is your first one. So after more than two years, Drupal has a new default theme. Better yet, we added a color picker that allows administrators to change the theme's color scheme without having to touch a single line of HTML/CSS.

So not only brings this new default core theme raw beauty, it is actually the easiest to customize Drupal theme in existence. Great job guys! *Bling, bling!*
