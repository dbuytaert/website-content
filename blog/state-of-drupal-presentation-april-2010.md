# State of Drupal presentation (April 2010)

Two weeks ago at DrupalCon San Francisco I gave my traditional state of Drupal presentation. A total of 6000 people watched my keynote live; 3000 were present at DrupalCon, and another 3000 watched the live video stream. Nonetheless, a lot of people asked me for my slides. So in good tradition, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-april-2010.pdf) (PDF, 48 MB) or you can [watch a video recording of my keynote on archive.org](http://archive.org/details/TheStateOfDrupal_100).
