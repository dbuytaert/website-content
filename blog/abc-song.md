# ABC song

Axl only started school 5 weeks ago so it is pretty amazing to see how fast he has picked up English. Not only can he sing some songs, he is actually getting pretty good at expressing himself in English. It is fascinating to watch.

Note that according to Axl, it is *zee* and not *zed*. Just in case you were wondering. ;-)

This is one of my first attempts at recording video with the Panasonic GF-1 and the Lumix 20mm f/1.7 lens that I got for Christmas last year. It's a shame that it took that long because it turns out to be an incredibly capable camera. This video was recorded handheld in natural light, and aside from some trimming in iMovie, no audio or video post-processing has been applied. I just love the short depth-of-field of the 20mm f/1.7 lens.
