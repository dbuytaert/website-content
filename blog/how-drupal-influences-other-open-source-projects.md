If you are interested in Open Source and have some time this weekend, watch [Steve Francia](https://stevefrancia.com)'s DrupalCon keynote called "[Drupal and the secret of my success](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJo9tPXGPo8)". Steve has been involved in Open Source for over 20 years, and has had the unique opportunity to lead three of the most successful Open Source companies in history. He was Chief Developer Advocate of MongoDB, Chief Operator of Docker, and now he is the Product Lead for the Go programming language at Google. Watch the video to hear Steve's personal story about how Drupal influenced his career, in addition to influencing MongoDB, Docker and Go. I don't often get emotional, but I had to wipe a few tears away during his presentation. Thanks for telling your story and being an inspiration, Steve!
