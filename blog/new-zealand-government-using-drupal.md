# New Zealand government using Drupal

The New Zealand government is using Drupal at <http://beehive.govt.nz>. The site features information about all their ministers, their speeches, press releases, ministerial briefings, major government initiatives and more. (Hat tip: [Bevan Rudge](https://www.js.geek.nz/))
