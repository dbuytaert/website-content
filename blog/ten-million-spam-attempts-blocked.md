Last weekend, [Mollom](https://mollom.com) blocked the ten millionth spam attempt. That is ten million tiny contributions to making the web a nicer place. We've been [growing pretty fast](https://www.mollom.com/scorecard). Drupal is still the main platform for users with Mollom subscriptions, with Joomla! coming second, and WordPress third. *Milestone weekend!*
