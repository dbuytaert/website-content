I'll be talking about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/) this year. FOSDEM, which stands for Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting, will take place in Brussels (Belgium) on February 24 and 25.

I got a last-minute invitation because Joe Hewitt from [Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) won't be able to make it. As an avid Firebug user, I find that quite bummer.

The title of my presentation will be *"Why Drupal is the answer, regardless of your question"*. If you have pressing questions that you want me to answer in the presentation (whose answer is "Drupal") or suggestions for topics to cover, let me know in the comments.
