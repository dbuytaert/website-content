# Arsenal using Drupal

As a Belgian sports fan, I will always be a loyal to the Belgium National Football Team. However, I am willing to extend my allegiance to Arsenal F.C. because they recently launched their new site in Drupal 8! As one of the most successful teams of England's Premier League, Arsenal has been lacing up for over 130 years. On the new Drupal 8 site, Arsenal fans can access news, club history, ticket services, and live match results. This is also a great example of collaboration with two Drupal companies working together - [Inviqa](https://inviqa.com) in the UK and [Phase2](https://www.phase2technology.com) in the US. If you want to see Drupal 8 on Arsenal's roster, check out <https://www.arsenal.com>!
