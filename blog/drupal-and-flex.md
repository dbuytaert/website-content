# Drupal and Flex

The past year or so, I've been dabbling my toes in [Adobe Flex](http://flex.org), a software development kit that makes it easy for application developers to build Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). As an early beta tester I've kept in touch with [Adobe](http://adobe.com) and under the guidance of [Mike Potter](http://riapedia.com/) (Adobe Flex team), Adobe has since funded Scott Nelson to work on the [Drupal services project](https://www.drupal.org/project/services) and the [Drupal AMF PHP project](https://www.drupal.org/project/amfphp). In the process they have also written code that fixes bugs for loading and saving content in Drupal, and more. *Thanks Adobe!*

A couple weeks ago, I invited Adobe to present at [DrupalCon Barcelona](http://drupalcon.org) and they accepted our invitation: [Christoph Rooms](http://www.christophrooms.com/) will provide a keynote presentation to show how Flex and Drupal can be used together. Furthermore, they'll show how Adobe is using Drupal and Flex for the new [Flex website](http://flex.org) that they hope to launch at [DrupalCon Barcelona](http://drupalcon.org)!

Also, next week on [September 5th at 17:00h CET](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=9&day=5&year=2007&hour=11&min=0&sec=0&p1=188), Mike would love to talk with some Drupal developers about Flex and the code that Adobe has contributed back to the Drupal project. So if you are a Drupal developer interested to learn more about what Adobe is doing with Drupal and Flex or if you have some Flex-related questions, let me know in the comments, and I'll try to get you an invite for the conference call and the online demo on September 5th. (You never know but you might be able to score a free Adobe Flex Builder license key.)
