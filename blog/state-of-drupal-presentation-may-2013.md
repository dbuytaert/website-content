Two weeks ago at DrupalCon Portland, I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation. A total of 3,500 were present at DrupalCon, a new record for DrupalCon attendance.

In good tradition, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-may-2013.pdf) (PDF, 29 MB) or you can [watch a video recording of my keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCLx4fRHmCk) (keynote starts at 14:00). The video of the White House guest appearance and the Drupal 8 demo video area also embedded in this post.
