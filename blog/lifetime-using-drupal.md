# Lifetime using Drupal

Lifetime Television redesigned using Drupal so check it out at <http://www.lifetimetv.com/>. Lifetime Television is a cable television network that caters to women. They produce shows such as Desperate Housewives, The Golden Girls, Frasier and Army Wives.

This is a massive Drupal site with a movie database, television schedule, videos, photos, editor-produced articles, user-produced stories, games, tag clouds, topic-based search, and a pretty perky looking theme.

The site was built with the help of the infamous [Lullabots](https://lullabot.com), [Treehouse](http://www.treehouseagency.com/) and [Achieve Internet](https://www.achieveinternet.com/).
