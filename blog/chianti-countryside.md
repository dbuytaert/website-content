As the first part of our honeymoon, we spent one week driving around the countryside in Tuscany, Italy. Our journey started in San Sano, a small village in the Chianti region famous for its rolling hills, olive groves and vineyards. Every night at dinner, we decided where to go the day after. So from San Sano, we moved on to explore several of the main towns and cities surrounding the Chianti region. We ended up in Siena, Colle di Val d'Elsa, Greve, Florence, Pietrasanta, and Lucca. I have a number of pictures (and anecdotes to go with them) lined up which I'll start posting soon. To set the stage, please find attached two pictures of the Chianti countryside.
