Ever wanted to see the [Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu)? An almost mythical place where *"...the future is lived, not imagined ... a world where radical technology advances are taken for granted, ..."* and technology is designed *"... for people to create a better future".*

I've visited the Media Lab before and it is highly recommended. This is your chance.

On Friday, June 12th, we're conducting a one-day Drupal.org redesign sprint at the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). Designed to bring home our kicking re-design for Drupal.org designed by [Mark Boulton](http://markboulton.co.uk) and [Leisa Reichelt](http://www.disambiguity.com), all Drupal designers and developers who would like to contribute to theming our new home at drupal.org are welcome, invited, and encouraged to attend. Attendance is limited, so you must sign-up in advance.

Even if you're "just" a newbie, we'll make sure to have you ready for attendance by activating your infrastructure.drupal.org account, by creating your own hosted copy of drupal.org for your localized testing, and by training you in working within the [redesign theme issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?issue_tags=Bluecheese%20theme).

If you are interested in helping – and I hope you are – please sign-up to schedule your training by visiting https://groups.drupal.org/node/22036. *Thanks!*
