We spent the weekend exploring Tuscany by car. Each day we drove through vineyards, hilltop towns and medieval cities on narrow, winding roads that often turned into unpaved backroads. Wanting to get the most out of the trip, we stopped from time to time to take in the amazing views and eat [pecorino cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecorino).
