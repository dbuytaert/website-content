I had just published my post about [having dinner with Garry Kasparov](https://dri.es/meeting-one-chess-master-mourning-another) when I got a call. Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever had dropped out of a [simultaneous exhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_exhibition) where Kasparov would play 20 people at once. Did I want to take his seat?

Of course I didn't hesitate. Within hours, I was sitting across a chessboard from Kasparov. I was never going to win. The question was: in how many moves would I lose?

Kasparov opened with white, and I defended with black using the [Caro-Kann defense](https://youtu.be/4GIsh7cTsHc?si=imW05QQ2g7T6cD7U). I blundered my rook on move 11. A mistake I'm still kicking myself over. But I kept fighting. A few times I made him pause and think for a minute or so. I resigned at move 25. None of the twenty players managed a draw or a win.

The event was livestreamed, with GM Nigel Short and FM Lennert Lenaerts providing commentary. Here is a snippet where they review my position:

This morning, I entered our game into Chess.com's analysis tool. Kasparov played with 94% accuracy, while I managed 80% accuracy (estimated 2100 ELO performance). Not bad for someone who hung a rook early. 

I'm grateful I got to play him. It's a game I'll remember for the rest of my life.
