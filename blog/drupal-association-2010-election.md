The [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) with fun­ding, infra­structure, events, promotion and distribution. The current Board of Directors was elected almost a year ago, so it's election time again!

On March 1st, 2010 we will elect new Permanent Members to the General Assembly. The General Assembly wil then select our Board of Directors, who are responsible for oversight of day-to-day operations. All the details can be found in the [Drupal Association's Statutes](https://www.drupal.org/associationabout/statutes-and-internal-regulations).

We are looking for people who aspire to become Directors on the Drupal Association's Board and who can provide leadership and experience to expand the reach of the Association and its activities. All current Board positions, except the President and Treasurer, are up for election, including Secretary, Legal Officer, Marketing and Communications, Infrastructure Manager, Fundraiser, and Events Manager.

The Association is also looking for new General Assembly members with skills in marketing, drupal.org webmaster coordination, project management and more. People interested in becoming a Permanent Members are invited to apply. While Permanent Members don't have the defined responsibilities of board members, membership implies a commitment to work for and promote the goals of the Association.

The Drupal Association is run by unpaid volunteers and we expect that our board members will spend a considerable amount of time working on Association responsibilities and obligations. If you think you're a good candidate, and you have the time it takes, find an [existing Permanent Member](https://www.drupal.org/associationabout/staff) to support your candidacy (i.e. find a supporter) and [submit your application](https://www.drupal.org/associationelection). Applications are due by February 22th and on March 1st, we elect the new Permanent Members and the new Board of Directors.

If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask them in the comments, or to [contact the Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/associationcontact).
