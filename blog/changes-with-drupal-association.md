# Changes with the Drupal Association

The [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) is very special because of [its culture of adapting to change](https://dri.es/the-pain-before-the-payoff), determination and passion, but also its fun and friendship. It is a combination that is hard to come by, even in the Open Source world. Our culture enabled us to work through really long, but ground-breaking release cycles, which also prompted us to celebrate the release of Drupal 8 with 240 parties around the world.

Throughout Drupal's 15 years history, that culture has served us really well. As the larger industry around us continues to change – see [my DrupalCon New Orleans keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2016) for recent examples – we have been able to evolve Drupal accordingly. Drupal has not only survived massive changes in our industry; it has also helped drive them. Very few open source projects are 15 years old and continue to gain momentum.

Drupal 8 is creating new kinds of opportunities for Drupal. For example, who could have imagined that Lufthansa would be using Drupal 8 to build its next-generation in-flight entertainment system? Drupal 8 changes the kind of end-user experiences people can build, how we think about Drupal, and what kind of people we'll attract to our community. I firmly believe that these changes are positive for Drupal, [increase Drupal's impact on the world](https://dri.es/reaching-the-next-billion-with-drupal), and grow the opportunity for our commercial ecosystem.

To seize [the big opportunity ahead of us](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2016) and to adjust to the changing environment, it was the Drupal Association's turn to adapt and carefully realign the Drupal Association's strategic focus.

The last couple of years the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) invested heavily in Drupal.org to support the development and the release of Drupal 8. Now Drupal 8 is released, the [Drupal Association's Board of Directors](https://www.drupal.org/association/board) made the strategic decision to shift some focus from the "contribution journey" to the "evaluator's adoption journey" – without compromising our ability to build and maintain the Drupal software. The Drupal Association will reduce its efforts on Drupal.org's collaboration tools and expand its efforts to grow Drupal's adoption and to build a larger ecosystem of technology partners.

We believe this is not only the right strategic focus at this point in Drupal 8's lifecycle, but also a necessary decision. While the Drupal Association's revenues continued to grow at a healthy pace, we invested heavily, and exhausted our available reserves supporting the Drupal 8 release. As a result, we have to right-size the organization, balance our income with our expenses, and focus on rebuilding our reserves.

In a blog post today, we provide [more details on why we made these decisions](https://assoc.drupal.org/blog/megansanicki/reorganizing-for-drupal) and how we will continue to build a healthy long-term organization. The changes we made today help ensure that Drupal will gain momentum for decades to come. We could not make this community what it is without the participation of each and every one of you. Thanks for your support!
