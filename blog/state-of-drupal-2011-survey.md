# State of Drupal 2011 survey

The last time I organized a State of Drupal survey was in 2008. The results of the 2008 survey were instrumental in shaping Drupal 7 as well as directing the work of the Drupal Association on drupal.org.

Now three years later, I created a new survey. The results of this survey will guide thousands of people in the Drupal community over the next two years.

[Take the State of Drupal 2011 survey now](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HZCPQNK).

It shouldn't take more than ten minutes to fill out. Don't worry if you're new to Drupal: every voice counts!

I'll present the results during my DrupalCon keynote in London; the video and the presentation slides will be downloadable after. Please do [tell us what you think these days about Drupal](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HZCPQNK): your views will shape Drupal 8 and beyond. *Thanks!*
