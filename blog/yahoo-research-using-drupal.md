Truth be told, between [trips to Yahoo!](https://dri.es/drupal-road-trip-san-francisco) including [last year's Drupal conference](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo), which they hosted, we already knew that Yahoo! is a major Drupal user. However, what is new is that they are starting to launch more and more external facing Drupal sites. Once such example is [Yahoo! Research](http://research.yahoo.com); check it out at <http://research.yahoo.com>.

Now if only we could get them to pay [Rasmus](http://lerdorf.com/bio.php) to work on Drupal core a bit. ;-)
