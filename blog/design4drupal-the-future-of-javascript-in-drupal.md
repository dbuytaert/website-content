# Design 4 Drupal: The future of JavaScript in Drupal 

[image drupal/drupal-is-no-longer-the-drupal-you-used-to-know]

Today, I gave a keynote presentation at the 10th annual [Design 4 Drupal conference](https://www.design4drupal.org/) at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/). I talked about the [past, present and future of JavaScript](https://dri.es/a-history-of-javascript-across-the-stack), and how this evolution reinforces Drupal's commitment to be [API-first, not API-only](https://dri.es/drupal-is-api-first-not-api-only). I also included behind-the-scene insights into the Drupal community's [administration UI and JavaScript modernization initiative](https://dri.es/working-toward-a-javascript-driven-drupal-administration-interface), and why this approach presents an exciting future for JavaScript in Drupal.

If you are interested in viewing my keynote, you can [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/design4drupal-keynote-2018.pdf) (256 MB).

Thank you to Design 4 Drupal for having me and happy 10th anniversary!
