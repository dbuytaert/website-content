When I ask people why they fell in love with Drupal, most often they talk about feeling empowered to build [ambitious websites](https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-digital-experiences) with little or no code. In fact, the journey of many Drupalists started with Drupal's low-code approach to site building.

With that in mind, I proposed [a new Project Browser initiative](https://www.drupal.org/project/ideas/issues/2940733) in [my DrupalCon North America keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2021). A Project Browser makes it easy for site builders to find and install modules. You shouldn't need to use the command line!

Making module discovery and module installation easier is long overdue. It's time to kick off this initiative! I will host the first meeting on [May 24th between 14:30 UTC and 15:15 UTC](https://time.is/1430_24_May_2021_in_UTC). We'll share a Zoom-link on the [Project Browser Slack channel](https://drupal.slack.com/archives/C01UHB4QG12) before the meeting starts. Join our Slack channel and mark your calendars.

We'll start the meeting with high-level planning, and we need people with all kinds of skills. For example, we'll need help defining requirements, help designing and prototyping the user experience, and much more.
