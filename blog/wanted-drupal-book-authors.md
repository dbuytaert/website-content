# Wanted: Drupal book authors

I've recently been contacted by a number of publishers that are actively looking for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) book authors. [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) sent me such a request today. They would like to hear from Drupal users any Drupal book ideas they may have and would like to see published, even if a proposed book caters for the needs of a smaller section of the Drupal community. They are also interested in hearing from any Drupal user who is interested in writing about Drupal, whether they have a specific book idea or not. If you have a book idea or if you are interested in writing about Drupal, let me know in the comments, and I'll introduce you to the right people.

The cool thing about [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) is that they have a lucrative [Open Source Project Royalty scheme](https://www.packtpub.com/article/packt_open_source_project_royalty_scheme). From [all the Drupal books published](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-books) to date, the [one from Packt Publishing](https://dri.es/packt-drupal-book) generated the most royalties for the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org). That alone gives me sufficient reason to publish their call for Drupal book ideas and Drupal book authors.
