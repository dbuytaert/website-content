# Drupal CMS: the official name for Drupal Starshot

[image drupal/drupal-cms-official-name]

We're excited to announce that "Drupal CMS" will be the official name for the product developed by the Drupal Starshot Initiative.

The name "Drupal CMS" was chosen after user testing with both newcomers and experienced users. This name consistently scored highest across all tested groups, including marketers unfamiliar with Drupal.

Participants appreciated the clarity it brings:

> Having the words CMS in the name will make it clear what the product is. People would know that Drupal was a content management system by the nature of its name, rather than having to ask what Drupal is.

> I'm a designer familiar with the industry, so the term CMS or content management system is the term or phrase that describes this product most accurately in my opinion. I think it is important to have CMS in the title.

The name "Drupal Starshot" will remain an internal code name until the first release of Drupal CMS, after which it will most likely be retired.
