The [Basque Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Parliament) has recently replaced a portion of its older site with a new Drupal site that can be seen at <http://www.parlamentovasco.euskolegebiltzarra.org>.

This continues the trend of various government bodies around the world using Open Source software – and especially Drupal to power their official websites.

The website was developed in cooperation with several Drupal companies, including [Bilbomática](https://www.bilbomatica.es/), [Serikat](https://www.serikat.es/) and [Ibermática](http://ibermatica.com/).
