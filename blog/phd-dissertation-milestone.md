# PhD dissertation milestone

I just sent the members of my PhD dissertation committee their copy of my dissertation. *Yay!*

Writing a PhD dissertation has been a completely new experience, and a challenging one for sure. Writing for weeks on end is hard. However, mailing your PhD dissertation to the members of your PhD dissertation committee is fun, and warrants a blog post.

The title of my PhD dissertation will be *Profiling techniques for Java performance analysis and optimization*. I'm fortunate to have two of the world's best Java people on my PhD dissertation committee – [James Gosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling) (the inventor of Java and Vice President at Sun Microsystems) and [Michael Hind](https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/view.php?person=us-hindm) (Senior Manager of the Programming Technologies Department at IBM Research) – so I'm looking forward to what they have to say about it.

Next up is my PhD defense. That and getting Drupal 6 out, of course.
