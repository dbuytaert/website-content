# Bonjour Montreal

I'm currently in Montreal (Canada) for [OOPSLA](http://oopsla.org), where [Andy](http://itkovian.net) will present [our statistically rigorous Java performance evaluation paper](https://dri.es/statistically-rigorous-java-performance-evaluation) and where I'll talk about our work on [using hardware performance monitors to drive dynamic compilation of Java applications](https://dri.es/using-hpm-sampling-to-drive-dynamic-compilation).

In addition to the PhD related festivities, Drupal rockstar [Angie Byron](http://webchick.net) is organizing [a Drupal dinner on Tuesday evening](https://groups.drupal.org/node/6423). *Drupal users unite!*

The WIFI at the Hyatt Regency in Montreal sucks monkey balls. I feel incredibly unproductive, cross and out of sync when I wake up in the middle of the night. So much for working the Drupal 6 issue queues ...
