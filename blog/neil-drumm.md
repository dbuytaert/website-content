Two months ago I invited [Neil Drumm](http://delocalizedham.com/) to become a *core committer* of the next Drupal version. For the duration of one release cycle, Neil will help [Steven Wittens](http://acko.net/) and myself to shape the face of the next Drupal version by identifying and coordinating interesting development efforts. I haven't been very verbose about my choice of Neil, but I figured it would be a pretty good hint as what I'd like to see us work on. Not unsurprisingly, this went mostly unnoticed.

I picked Neil for two reasons. First and foremost, Neil doesn't like [complexity](/complexity-is-a-disease). People tend to propose incomprehensibly complex solutions, and Neil has quite a knack for detecting attempts to get cruft into Drupal. Secondly, Neil has been the co-founder and maintainer of [CivicSpace](http://civicspacelabs.org/), the first Drupal distribution. In his role at CivicSpace, Neil has been actively involved with the development of an install system. I hope that in his new post, Neil will help coordinate the development of a cruft-free install, upgrade and dependency system for core.

It is needed [to get custom content types in core](/custom-content-types) and part of [the larger goal to make Drupal easier to use and develop for](/complexity-is-a-disease).
