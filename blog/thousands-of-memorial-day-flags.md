More than 37,000 American flags are on the [Boston Common](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Common) – an annual tribute to fallen military service members. Seeing all these flags was moving, made me pause, and recognize that Memorial Day weekend is not just about time off from work, outdoor BBQs with friends, or other fun start-of-summer festivities.
