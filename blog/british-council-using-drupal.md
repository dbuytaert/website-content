[English Online](http://www.englishonline.org.cn) is an initiative created by the [British Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Council) to encourage the learning of English in China.

In good [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) style, the site boasts a number of social networking features such as personal profiles, blogs and forums to connect a community of over 60,000 users. Users can customize content in Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional and English. Other features include video, newsletters, an events calendar, as well as a mobile version of the site at <http://m.englishonline.org.cn>.

The site, developed by [Brightlemon](http://www.brightlemon.com), was also referenced in [Gordon Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown)'s recent visit to China.
