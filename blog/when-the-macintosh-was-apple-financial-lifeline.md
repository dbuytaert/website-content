# When the Macintosh was Apple's financial lifeline

[image blog/imac-financial-lifeline resize=false]

I love this graph. It shows that for some time, Apple's primary source of revenue was the sale of the [Macintosh computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh). The Macintosh provided Apple with a bridge between the desktop era and the mobile era, represented by the two clusters on the graph. That bridge was a financial lifeline. Without it, Apple might not have survived.
