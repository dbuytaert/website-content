# IBM adds DB2 support to Drupal

IBM's Internet Technology Group posted the [ninth article](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource9/index.html) in their series entitled [Using open source software to design, develop, and deploy a collaborative website](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html). In [this article](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/i-osource9/index.html), IBM explains Drupal's database layer, shows module developers how to write portable database code and explains how to install and maintain a module's database schema from one version to another. Last but not least, they show how to add support for their [IBM DB2 Express-C database](https://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/). *Sweet!*

(Idea: if you are a publisher, get in touch with IBM, and see if you can work with them to make a Drupal book out of [their Drupal articles](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/osource/implement.html)?)
