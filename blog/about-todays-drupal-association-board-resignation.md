Today [Morten Birch Heide-Jørgensen stepped down from his role on the Drupal Association's Board of Directors](http://www.morten.dk/blog/language-twitter-misunderstanding-drupal-community). The Drupal Association's Board of Directors supports Morten's decision. The [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) and the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) value inclusivity and diversity, and our leadership must demonstrate those values as well.

We want to thank Morten for his service; he came to the board with a mission to foster improved transparency and communication. He helped both the board and staff embrace those principles in a way that will carry into the future.

Today's development underscores the need for a broader discussion that we need to have about inclusivity and diversity. Creating and maintaining the right culture and environment is vital to Drupal's success. Therefore, we have asked the [Community Working Group](https://www.drupal.org/governance/community-working-group) to define a process to help our community address these issues and identify positive, proactive, and concrete steps we can take to ensure that everyone feels welcome in Drupal.

Morten is vacating a community elected seat. The Board of Directors will discuss how and when to fill this vacancy at the next board meeting.

Respectfully,

[Drupal Association Board of Directors](https://www.drupal.org/association/board)
