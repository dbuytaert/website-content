# Amnesty using Drupal

[Rob Purdie](http://importantprojects.com/archives/000132.php) just announced that [Amnesty International](http://amnesty.org) relaunched on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Check it out at <http://amnesty.org> ...

It looks like Drupal's localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) features were used to translate the website into 3 languages; [an Arabic translation](https://www.amnesty.org/ar/) is available as well. (Arabic is written predominantly right-to-left which, frankly, is funny to watch but hard to implement in a CMS.)

Roughly a week ago, [Wim Mostrey](http://mostrey.be/) from [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/) already gave a sneak preview of the new Amnesty Interational site at [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.be). One remarkable fact that I'd would like to learn more about is the integration with [Alfresco](http://alfresco.com), an Open Source document management system written in Java.
