Last week, we met at [DrupalCamp Köln](https://dri.es/drupalcamp-koln-wrapup-2008) in Germany to start planning [the Drupal.org redesign work](https://dri.es/drupal-org-redesign-code-sprints). The intent of the meeting was to get a better handle on the work ahead of us, and to make preliminary design decisions. Further, we're starting to establish how we'll work together, and ultimately, how we scale out the work in the future.

We all went home from Germany with additional work to do:

- [Olav Schettler](https://www.drupal.org/user/2098) is researching OpenID servers and will share his findings in the [drupal.org redesign group](https://groups.drupal.org/drupalorg-redesign-plan-drupal-association).
- [Gábor Hojtsy](https://www.drupal.org/user/4166) took on the responsibility of dissecting Mark's design, mapping features onto modules, and helping to create a continuous integration environment to test the upgrade.
- [Robert Douglass](https://www.drupal.org/user/5449) agreed to do research on our search requirements, and will develop a comparison and discussion plan.
- We formed a group of theme designers under the guidance of [Mike O'Connor](https://www.drupal.org/user/104525) and [Morten](https://www.drupal.org/user/65676) (King of Denmark) that will investigate our theme options and how to best translate Mark Boulton's designs to a working theme. If you want to help, contact them using their personal contact pages to join their temporary new group on groups.drupal.org. The drupal.org style guide is published at <https://infrastructure.drupal.org/drupal.org-style-guide>.
- [Fago](https://www.drupal.org/user/16747) agreed to research friend and buddy lists. Drupal.org is as much (if not more) a social site than a content site and Mark's design promotes the social aspect even further.
- [Gerhard Killesreiter](https://www.drupal.org/user/83) and [Damien Tournoud](https://www.drupal.org/user/22211) are working on getting a test and development server set up so we can do continuous testing.
- I agreed to continue my focus on coordination, communication, fundraising, financials, and more – hence this blog post.

As the next step, about 10 of us are heading to Boston next week to begin work on the Drupal 5 to Drupal 6 upgrade of drupal.org. The list of people include: [Gábor Hojtsy](https://www.drupal.org/user/4166), [Derek Wright](https://www.drupal.org/user/46549) (project module), [Chad Phillips](https://www.drupal.org/user/22079) (project module), [Dave Reid](https://www.drupal.org/user/53892), [Damien Tournoud](https://www.drupal.org/user/22211), [Neil Drumm](https://www.drupal.org/user/3064), [Susan MacPhee](https://www.drupal.org/user/188603), [Jeremy Andrews](https://www.drupal.org/user/409), [Narayan Newton](https://www.drupal.org/user/94675), [David Strauss](https://www.drupal.org/user/93254) and myself.

So far, the fundraising is going well. Various companies have stepped up to donate human resources. Kudos go to [One Laptop Per Child](http://laptop.org) (OLPC), [AF83](https://www.af83.com/), [Four Kitchens](https://www.fourkitchens.com/), [DrupalTherapy](http://www.drupaltherapy.com/), [OpenBand](https://www.drupal.org/user/325708), [Looforyoo](http://looforyoo.com), [NowPublic](http://nowpublic.com), [Tag1 Consulting](http://tag1consulting.com) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com).

However, if we want to make it to Paris to continue the work, we need more money and more attendees! If you're available to attend the sprint in Paris, and if you can help us upgrade modules or write new modules, please let me know.

If you can't make it to either Boston or Paris, the best way to help is to review the overview at <https://www.drupal.org/node/362117>, the list of issues at <https://www.drupal.org/project/issues-term/346>, and help us tackle them one by one. These URLs reflect a live and accurate view of our progress so everyone can help – bookmark these pages and start participating today! We hope that many people will help us remotely as we work on this list of issues. *Thanks!*
