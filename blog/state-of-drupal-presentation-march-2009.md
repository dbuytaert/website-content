Last week at [DrupalCon DC](https://dri.es/drupalcon-dc) I gave my traditional state of Drupal presentation [in front of 1400 Drupalistas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrys/3333486097/in/set-72157614803077544/). The video of the presentation is provided below, and you can download a [copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-march-2009.pdf) (PDF, 20 MB) as well. The video is available in alternative encoding formats from [archive.org](http://archive.org/details/DrupalconDC2009-DriesKeynote). Topics I talked about: the history of Drupal, the Drupal 7 release, the future of Drupal, etc. *Have a look!*
