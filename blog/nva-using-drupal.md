# N-VA using Drupal

The New Flemish Alliance (Dutch: Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie, abbreviated as N-VA) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for their website: <http://www.n-va.be>. The N-VA is a Flemish political party. They became the largest party in both Flanders and Belgium in the 2010 federal elections a few weeks ago.
