Cable news network CNN just released [CNNgo.com](http://cnngo.com) into beta, fully developed with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). CNNgo is a guide to six of Asia's greatest cities. What is interesting about the site is that they are looking to complement their professional editors with local bloggers, opinion makers, and the very people that form the soul of these cities.

As a traditional publisher, you have to figure out how to turn audiences into participants because it opens the doors for better advertising and new monetization opportunities. I think [CNNgo.com](http://cnngo.com) is a great example of how companies like CNN can use the power of Drupal to implement a social media strategy through an add-on site.
