Spending a few days at the Cayman Islands, where the WiFi is weak and the rum is strong. When I relax, I become creative and reflective. Writing helps me develop these creative thoughts and deepens my personal reflection. It's a virtuous cycle, because when I see my world, myself and my ideas more clearly, it helps me relax even more. Relaxing makes me write and writing makes me relax.
