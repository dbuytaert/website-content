Do you have questions about the upcoming Drupal 8 release (or Drupal 9 and beyond)? On Thursday, June 5 at [DrupalCon Austin](https://austin2014.drupal.org), I'll be moderating a [question-and-answer core conversation](https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/qa-dries) with a panel of key Drupal 8 contributors. Questions are [submitted in advance online](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCIkj9O5fF4TSJB-iR-nUxpCQ3POvF8U9j3AdU9j2a6KaN6w/viewform), and anyone can submit a question. I will curate the submissions to ask the panel the most interesting and relevant questions.

This is a rare opportunity for the community to communicate directly with the trailblazers who are shaping Drupal 8 into the best release of Drupal yet. Help us make the most of of it – [submit your questions now!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCIkj9O5fF4TSJB-iR-nUxpCQ3POvF8U9j3AdU9j2a6KaN6w/viewform)
