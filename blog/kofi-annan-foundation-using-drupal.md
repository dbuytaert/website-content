The [Kofi Annan Foundation](http://kofiannanfoundation.org) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Kofi Annan was the Secretary-General of the United Nations. In 2001 Kofi Annan and the United Nations were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. Since leaving the United Nations, the [Kofi Annan Foundation](http://kofiannanfoundation.org) supports Kofi Annan in his current work to press for better policies to meet the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable in the world.
