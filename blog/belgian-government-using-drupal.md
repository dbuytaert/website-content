The Belgium government is using Drupal at <http://invest.belgium.be>.

It is the website of "Only in Belgium", a campaign to promote companies to invest in the Belgian industry. The campaign, and the accompanying website, are being promoted in the media and on national television.

The design of the ["Only in Belgium" website](http://invest.belgium.be) was done by [Prophet](http://www.prophet.be/) and the implementation was done by [dotProjects](http://www.dotprojects.be/) – two Belgian companies.

I'm told that the ["Only in Belgium" website](http://invest.belgium.be) will be translated to seven languages, and that the Belgian government has additional Drupal sites in the pipeline. *Good stuff!*

It's great to see Drupal gain some traction in governments. If you think about it, Drupal is also the ideal tool for local government websites: it is powerful technology that is cheap and independent and that lends itself to collaboration. Local governments could team up with other towns and local web development shops to work on a common technology platform. What is often missing are local Drupal experts that want to coordinate such initiatives.
