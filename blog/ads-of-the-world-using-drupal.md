# "Ads of the World" using Drupal

[Ads of the World](http://adsoftheworld.com) is a great, fast growing Drupal website that I wanted to blog about for some time now. It's a community for advertising professionals, but it has lots of great stuff to like – especially if you're a wannabe photographer like me.

The site is run by [Ivan Raszl](http://raszl.net) and was built with the help from the [Drupal ninjas at 2bits.com](https://2bits.com).
