# Working together to promote Drupal

The Drupal community has done an amazing job organizing thousands of developers around the world. We've built collaboration tools and engineering processes to streamline how our community of developers work together to collectively build Drupal. This collaboration has led to amazing results. Today, more than 1 in 40 of the top one million websites use [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). It's inspiring to see how many organizations depend on Drupal to deliver their missions.

What is equally incredible is that historically, we haven't collaborated around the marketing of Drupal. Different organizations have marketed Drupal in their own way without central coordination or collaboration.

In my [DrupalCon Nashville keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2018), I shared that it's time to make a serious and focused effort to amplify Drupal success stories in the marketplace. Imagine what could happen if we enabled hundreds of marketers to collaborate on the promotion of Drupal, much like we have enabled thousands of developers to collaborate on the development of Drupal.

### Accelerating Drupal adoption with business decision makers

To focus Drupal's marketing efforts, we launched the [Promote Drupal Initiative](https://www.drupal.org/promotedrupal). The goal of the Promote Drupal Initiative is to do what we do best: to work together to collectively grow Drupal. In this case, we want to collaborate to raise awareness with business and non-technical decision makers. We need to hone Drupal's strategic messaging, amplify success stories and public relation resources in the marketplace, provide agencies and community groups with sales and marketing tools, and [improve the Drupal.org evaluator experience](https://dri.es/three-ways-we-can-improve-drupal-evaluator-experience).

To make Promote Drupal sustainable, [Rebecca Pilcher](https://www.drupal.org/u/ryeburd), Director of MarComm at the Drupal Association, will be leading the initiative. Rebecca will oversee volunteers with marketing and business skills that can help move these efforts forward.

### Promote Drupal Fund: 75% to goal

At DrupalCon Nashville, [we set a goal of fundraising $100,000](https://www.drupal.org/promotedrupal) to support the Promote Drupal Initiative. These funds will help to secure staffing to backfill Rebecca's previous work (someone has to market DrupalCon!), produce critical marketing resources, and sponsor marketing sprints. The faster we reach this goal, the faster we can get to work.

I'm excited to announce that we have already reached 75% of our goal, thanks to many generous organizations and individuals around the world. I wanted to extend a big thank you to the following companies for contributing $1,000 or more to the Promote Drupal Initiative:

If you can, please [help us reach our total goal of $100,000](https://www.drupal.org/promotedrupal)! By raising a final $25,000, we can build a program that will introduce Drupal to an emerging audience of business decision makers. Together, we can make a big impact on Drupal.
