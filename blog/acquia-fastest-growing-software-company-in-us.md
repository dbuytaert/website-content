# Acquia fastest growing software company in US

Wow!

Today it was announced that [Acquia is the eighth company on the Inc 500](http://www2.inc.com/ss/inc5000/john-mcdermott/inc-500-top-10-2012-inc-500#3). This means we are the eight fastest growing private company in the United States. With nearly 7 million private companies in the US, being honored as number eight is an enormous accolade. In addition, we are the first software company on the list, making Acquia the [fastest growing software company in the US](https://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2012/industry/software). The current print edition of Inc Magazine also has a two page profile on [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com).

This honor is attributed to each and every Acquian. I'm so proud to be part of such a hardworking and dedicated team! *Go Acquia! Go Drupal!*
