I've posted a good bit about [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) lately, because we had a lot of exciting things happening, and because I'm proud of the body of work that the Acquia team is producing, often in close cooperation with the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org).

Still, a lot of people ask me how Acquia is doing and whether the support business model is working. In this post, and in an [accompanying press release](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-adds-200-new-customers-six-months-upending-traditional-web-c), I want to provide some additional insight in the state of Acquia's support business model.

As you might remember, [Acquia opened for business in October 2008](https://dri.es/acquia-out-of-beta), less than one year ago. In less than one year, Acquia now supports over 250 enterprise customers across a wide variety of markets. In the last six months, we've quadrupled our customer base and now help support open-source solutions in places where proprietary software once predominated. Places like [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/), [Intuit](https://www.intuit.com/), [WEEI](http://weei.radio.com/), [Sony Music](https://www.sonymusic.com/), [Adobe](http://adobe.com) and more.

The reality is that with less than one year into the Drupal support business, it is too early for us to tell if the support business model will be viable for Drupal. We need many more customers before we've built a scalable business; however, the early signs are good and beat our expectations.

Acquia has grown substantially from its beginnings less than two years ago, and since opening its doors for business less than one year ago. The road to making Acquia a successful company is still long but I'm very excited about what we have accomplished to date, and where Acquia is heading with its new products and services.
