# Teach.gov using Drupal

[image drupal/teach-gov]

The U.S. Department of Education just launched a new micro-site built on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org): teach.gov. At [teach.gov](http://teach.gov) you can learn what it's like to be a teacher and get the tools you need to launch your own career in education.

The site looks surprisingly crisp and modern for a government site, don't you think?

These kinds of micro-sites make a lot of sense. Visitors that are looking for particular information want instant gratification. It is much better to create a micro-site for this than to embed the same content two levels deep in [ed.gov](http://ed.gov) (also a Drupal site). No need to get bogged down with ed.gov's navigation, visual design or mix of target audiences.

While building highly targeted and compelling micro-sites makes a lot of sense, they can be expensive and time-consuming to build and maintain.
