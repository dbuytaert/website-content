# Second Life using Drupal

With all the [craziness surrounding Second Life](https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/technology/content/oct2006/tc20061017_127435.htm), it is probably worth pointing out that [Linden Lab](http://lindenlab.com) (creators of [Second Life](http://secondlife.com)) uses Drupal for [http://lindenlab.com](https://www.lindenlab.com/) and <http://teen.secondlife.com>.

And from the looks, they use [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) for [their official Second Life blog](http://blog.secondlife.com). Great to see that start-ups can excel (and be profitable faster) with the help of FOSS.
