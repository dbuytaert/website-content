# EA using Drupal for Battlefield Heroes

Computer and video game developer [Electronic Arts](http://www.ea.com) (EA) is using Drupal for their upcoming shooter game called [Battlefield Heroes](http://www.battlefield-heroes.com). I'm not big on games, but [their trailer looks fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYQP-uBijWg) so maybe I'll give it a try.

According to the trailer, they have big plans for their website. They want to use it to host a *long-running territorial conflict meta-game*. Curious to learn if that will be built in Drupal too.
