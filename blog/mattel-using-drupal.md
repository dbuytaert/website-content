Mattel, the world's largest toy company, just relaunched [Mattel.com](http://mattel.com) on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). The site was built by Vancouver-based [work \[at\] play](http://www.workatplay.com/). Mattel products include Barbie dolls, Hot Wheels, Matchbox cars, Masters of the Universe, and [much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel#Products). *For once, my kids and family will understand what I'm talking about. ;-)*
