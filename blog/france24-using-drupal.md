[France24](http://www.france24.com/en/), France's answer to BBC World and CNN, recently switched from [Magnolia](http://www.magnolia.info), an Open Source CMS written in Java, to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). What is interesting is that France24 was [one of Magnolia's flagship references](http://www.magnolia.info/en/about-magnolia/news-room/magnolia-powers-france24.html) ... I wonder what happened.
