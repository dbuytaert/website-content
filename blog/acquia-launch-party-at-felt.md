# Acquia launch party at Felt

At DrupalCon Boston, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) sponsored a launch party at the [Felt club in Boston](http://www.feltclubboston.com/). Jeff Robbins from [Lullabot](https://lullabot.com) performed live with its former rock band [Orbit](http://www.orbitband.com/), and Acquia's Jay Batson took the crowd deep into the night with progressive house and trance music. *Great parteeh!*
