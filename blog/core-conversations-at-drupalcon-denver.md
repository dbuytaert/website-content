Like at previous DrupalCon's, I'm co-organizing a [Core Conversations track at DrupalCon Denver](https://denver2012.drupal.org/core-conversations).

The Core Conversations track is a place for people actively working on Drupal or Drupal.org to meet and plan the future of Drupal. Each session is either two 15 minute or one 30 minute presentation, followed by 30 minutes of discussion.

I know a lot of you contribute to Drupal or want to start contributing. If so, Core Conversations are a unique opportunity to present in front of key Drupal contributors, and to make the case for why we need to do more of A or B (e.g. authoring experience improvements, API overhauls, etc.). We need UX conversations, performance conversations, feature conversations, etc. Please share your ideas with the world through Drupal core.

If you have ideas for Drupal core, and you are attending DrupalCon, I suggest that you submit a proposal as soon as possible. The deadline is February 1st so don't wait too long. To get your ideas flowing, here are our conversations from [Drupalcon London](https://london2011.drupal.org/conference/selected-coreconversations) and [Drupal Chicago](https://chicago2011.drupal.org/schedule/core).
