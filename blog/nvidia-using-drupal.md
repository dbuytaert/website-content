# NVidia using Drupal

[NVidia](http://nvidia.com) recently launched their [new Tegra developer community](https://developer.nvidia.com/tegra-development) on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). See <https://developer.nvidia.com/tegra-development>. The announcement of the latest Tegra 2 chipset was one of the major news items at [CES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show) earlier this month. The Tegra 2 chipset incorporates 8 independent processors to handle web browsing, HD video encoding/decoding as well as mobile gaming, all with very low power consumption. It is perfect for tablets ...

NVidia came to [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) to help them get the site built. Development was done by [Chapter Three](https://chapterthree.com) (an Acquia partner) and [Wiredcraft](https://wiredcraft.com/), while Acquia hosts the site on the [Acquia Hosting](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-managed-cloud) platform and provides 24x7 monitoring and support. They are also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect their site against spammers.
