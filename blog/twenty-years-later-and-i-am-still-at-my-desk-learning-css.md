I was working on [my POSSE plan](https://dri.es/my-posse-plan-for-evolving-my-site) when Vanessa called and asked if I wanted to meet for a coffee. Of course, I said yes. In the car ride over, I was thinking about how I made my first website over twenty years ago. HTML table layouts were still cool and it wasn't clear if CSS was going to be widely adopted. I decided to learn CSS anyway. More than twenty years later, the workflows, the automated toolchains, and the development methods have become increasingly powerful, but also a lot more complex. Today, [you simply npm your webpack via grunt with vue babel or bower to react asdfjkl;lkdhgxdlciuhw](https://frankchimero.com/writing/everything-easy-is-hard-again/). Everything is different now, except that I'm still at my desk learning CSS.
