Cheers to the [Acquia launch](https://dri.es/acquia-out-of-beta), which went really well. Hundreds of people signed up for a [free community subscription](https://www.acquia.com/acquia-subscription-pricing-old). Also, check out [Jeff Whatcott's blog post](https://www.acquia.com/blog/acquia-launch-round-looking-back-big-day) covering some of the blog posts, press articles, and Tweets about our new product and service offerings. *Awesome!*
