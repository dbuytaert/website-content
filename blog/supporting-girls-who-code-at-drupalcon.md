# Supporting Girls Who Code at DrupalCon

For most people, today marks the first day of DrupalCon Seattle.

Open Source communities create better, more inclusive software when diverse people come to the table. Unfortunately, there is still a huge gender gap in Open Source, and software more broadly. It's something I'll talk more about in my keynote tomorrow.

One way to help close the gender gap in the technology sector is to give to organizations that are actively working to solve this problem. During DrupalCon Seattle, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) will donate $5 to [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) for every person that visits our booth.
