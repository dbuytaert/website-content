# Schwag from New York

Earlier this month, about 130 Drupalistas descended upon the [Brooklyn Polytechnic](http://www.poly.edu/) to talk Drupal at [the third DrupalCamp in New York City](http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampNYC3). [Jacob Redding](http://wiredgeek.com), co-organizer of DrupalCamp NYC, was kind enough to send me some custom-made Drupal schwag.

OK, I begged for it. I really liked the t-shirt so I asked Jacob if I could buy one! *Thanks Jacob!*

The t-shirt design itself was made by [Andrew Stevenson](http://www.squidgystudios.com/), famous for his [many great Drupal paintings](http://www.thelifeofme.com/category/drupal).
