The O'Reilly Drupal book, titled [Using Drupal](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596515804), finally arrived in the mail. *Yay!*

I provided technical review of some early versions of chapters, and as promised, the book is as good as you'd suspect it would be from [Lullabot](https://lullabot.com) and [O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/). *Great work [Angela](http://webchick.net), [Addi](http://rocktreesky.com), [Nate](http://quicksketch.org), [Jeff Eaton](http://jeff.viapositiva.net), [James](http://walkah.net), and [Jeff Robbins](http://www.jjeff.com)!*
