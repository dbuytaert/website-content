# Royal Flemish Philharmonic using Drupal

The website of the [Royal Flemish Philharmonic](http://defilharmonie.be) is now using Drupal. The concept and design work was done by [Internet Architects](https://www.internetarchitects.be/), the implementation itself by [dotProjects](http://www.dotprojects.be/). *Another Belgian Drupal site!*
