# Drupal.org gets videos that make Drupal easier to learn

In the beginning of the year I started doing [some iOS development](https://dri.es/posting-my-phone-battery-status-to-my-site) for [my POSSE plan](https://dri.es/my-posse-plan-for-evolving-my-site). As I was new to iOS development, I decided to teach myself by watching short, instructional videos. Different people learn in different ways, but for me, videos tutorials were the most effective way to learn.

Given that recent experience, I'm very excited to share that all of the task tutorials in the [Drupal 8 User Guide](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/index.html) are now accompanied by video tutorials. These videos are embedded directly into every user guide page on Drupal.org. You can see an example on the ["Editing with the in-place editor" page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/content-in-place-edit.html).

These videos provide a great introduction to installing, administering, site building and maintaining the content of a Drupal-based website – all important skills for a new Drupalist to learn. Supplementing user guides with video tutorials is an important step towards [improving our evaluator experience](https://dri.es/three-ways-we-can-improve-drupal-evaluator-experience), as video can often convey a lot more than text.

Creating high-quality videos is hard and time-consuming work. Over the course of six months, the team at [Drupalize.Me](https://drupalize.me) has generously contributed a total of 52 videos! I want to give a special shout-out to [Joe Shindelar](https://www.drupal.org/u/eojthebrave) and the Drupalize.Me team for creating these videos and to [Jennifer Hodgdon](https://www.drupal.org/u/jhodgdon) and [Neil Drumm](https://www.drupal.org/u/drumm) ([Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association)) for helping to get each video posted on Drupal.org.

What a fantastic gift to the community!
