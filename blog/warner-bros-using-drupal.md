[Ethan](http://www.blackrimglasses.com/) just let me know that the main Warner Bros Records website, <http://www.warnerbrosrecords.com> (or <http://wbr.com>), is a Drupal site. Furthermore, rumor has it that the design was done by [Prod4ever](http://www.prod4ever.com) and that the Drupal integration was done by [AlianDesign](http://aliandesign.com/). *Well, it looks smashing!*

Ethan is the Head of Technology at Warner Bros Records, and last time I met him, he was [looking to hire more Drupal talent](https://dri.es/on-hiring-drupal-talent). People like [Madonna](http://madonna.com), [Metallica](https://www.metallica.com/), [Paris Hilton](http://www.parishiltonrecord.com/) and the [White Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com/) work for Warner Bros Records, so you'd expect a great work environment. ;-)
