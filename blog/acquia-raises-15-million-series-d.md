I'm thrilled to announce that [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) has received $15 million in its fourth round of funding – that is about twice as much as any of our earlier rounds ([series A](https://dri.es/acquia-raises-7-million-series-a), [series B](https://dri.es/acquia-raises-8-million-series-b), [series C](https://dri.es/acquia-raises-8-5-million-series-c)). Our previous investors affirmed their confidence by participating in this round; they were joined by [Tenaya Capital](http://www.tenayacapital.com), which has roots in both the San Francisco Bay Area and our home turf of Boston. Tenaya brings more than money: Tenaya's [Brian Paul](https://www.tenayacapital.com/team/brian-paul) will join our Board of Directors as well.

This is an incredibly exciting time to be at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com). Since the series C last November, our staff size has almost doubled, from 70 to 130. We're bursting out of our office space and will be moving to a bigger, 35,000 square feet office soon. We needed all those people to service our thousand-plus enterprise customers, and to plan for the future with new initiatives, such as [Dev Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-introduces-two-new-cloud-hosting-offerings) and [the newly revised Acquia Network](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-reboots-acquia-network). We broke revenue records in Q1 and Q2 this year, following [an extremely successful 2010](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2010).

Fundraising rounds usually occur either when a company is doing very well, or when it's doing very badly. When it's doing well, investors want to get in on the action to score big. When it's doing badly, current investors hope to turn it around to avoid losing everything they'd already put into it. By all measures, Acquia is doing very well, and this round of funding only confirms that. This is what is called a "growth round", with the money directed toward two objectives:

- **Increase sales and marketing, particularly outside the U.S..** It's clear that there are tremendous opportunities for enterprise Drupal outside of the U.S., as [our partners](https://www.acquia.com/partners/finder) prove every day. We'll start by focusing on Western Europe, but are already planning expansion into Asia.
- **Acquire talent and products that complement Acquia's own.** These "acquia-sitions" (as we jokingly call them) will continue to beef up our staff, expand our product offerings, and respond to requests we've gotten over our three and a half years in business.

Acquia's growth is a testament to the growth of Drupal; we'll continue to give back to the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) in everything what we do. Acquia wouldn't have made it this far without our customers, our partners, our employees and our friends. Thank you!
