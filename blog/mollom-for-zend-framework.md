# Mollom for Zend Framework

[Ruben Vermeersch](https://weblog.savanne.be/149-zend-service-mollom-1-0-0-1-1-0) has released a [Zend Framework](https://framework.zend.com/) library for [Mollom](https://mollom.com). From Ruben's [release announcement](https://weblog.savanne.be/149-zend-service-mollom-1-0-0-1-1-0), <q>Mollom checks your comments and provide CAPTCHAs if it's not 100% sure (about 2% of all comments). This takes the hard work of removing spam out of your hands, with the reassurance that no good content will be blocked.</q>.

The Zend Framework is an extensible set of components for building web applications and web services, with more than 7 million downloads and 500 different contributors. Ruben's contribution of the Mollom component allows Zend Framework users to take advantage of Mollom's unique approach to blocking comment and post spam. *Thanks Ruben!*
