# Optimizing your product strategy for the short- and long-term

Most products cycle through the infamous [Innovation S-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_life_cycle), which maps a product's value and growth over time.

Startups are eager to find *product-market fit*, the inflection point in which the product takes off and experiences *hockey-stick growth* (the transition from phase one to phase two).

Just as important, however, is the *stagnation point*, or the point later in the S-curve when a product experiences growth stagnation (the transition from phase two to phase three). Many startups don't think about their stagnation point, but I believe they should, because it determines how big the product can become.

Ten years ago, a couple years after [Acquia's founding](https://dri.es/acquia-my-drupal-startup), large organizations were [struggling with scaling Drupal](https://dri.es/drupal-in-the-cloud). I was absolutely convinced that Drupal could scale, but I also recognized that too few people knew how to scale Drupal successfully.

Furthermore, there was [a lot of skepticism around Open Source scalability and security](https://dri.es/clickability-fud-on-open-source-versus-saas). People questioned whether a community of volunteers could create software as secure and scalable as their proprietary counterparts.

These struggles and concerns were holding back Drupal. To solve both problems, [we built and launched Acquia Cloud](https://dri.es/acquia-hosting-now-available), a platform to build, host and manage Drupal sites.

After we launched Acquia Cloud, Acquia grew from $1.4 million in bookings in 2009 to [$8.7 million in bookings in 2010](https://dri.es/acquia-goes-to-the-caribbean) (600% year-over-year growth), and to $22 million in bookings by 2011 (250% year-over-year growth). We had clearly found product-market fit!

Not only did it launch Acquia in rocket-ship growth, it also extended our stagnation point. We on-boarded many large organizations and showed that [Drupal can scale very large](https://dri.es/how-nbc-sports-supports-the-biggest-media-events-online). This helped unlock a lot of growth for both [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/). I can say with certainty that [many large organizations that use Drupal](https://dri.es/happy-seventeenth-birthday-drupal) would not have adopted Drupal without Acquia.

<p class="pullquote">Helping to grow Drupal – or extending Drupal's stagnation point – was always part of Acquia's mission. From day one, we understood that for Acquia to grow, Drupal had to grow.</p>

Launching Acquia Cloud was a great business decision for Acquia; it gave us product-market fit, launched us in hockey-stick growth, but also extended our S-curve.

As I think back about how Acquia approached the [Innovation S-curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_life_cycle), a few important lessons stand out:

- Focus on business opportunities that serve a burning customer need that can launch or accelerate your organization.
- Focus on business opportunities that remove long-term barriers to growth and push out the stagnation point.
