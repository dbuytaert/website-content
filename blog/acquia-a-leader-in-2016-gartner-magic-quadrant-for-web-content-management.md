# Acquia a leader in 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management

This week Acquia was named a leader in the [Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management](https://www.acquia.com/resources/whitepapers/acquia-named-leader-2016-gartner-magic-quadrant-web-content-management). We're quite excited about it at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) as it's the third year in a row that we received this recognition from [Gartner](http://gartner.com).

Organizations planning large WCM deployments rely on reports such as the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management to give them a comprehensive view of the competitive landscape. Acquia's strong placement will cause many organizations to give Drupal a closer look for their content management projects. Acquia is the only open source company included among the six leaders, and as [CMSWire's Dom Nicastro reported](https://www.cmswire.com/digital-experience/gartner-boots-opentext-sdl-hp-from-its-wcm-leaders-quadrant/), "Acquia made the biggest positive move" of all the solutions ranked in Gartner's report.

What I found especially interesting in this year's report was their observation that the WCM market is beginning to split in two subcategories: the first subcategory treats the web as an ever more important channel for marketing and communications; the second subcategory is focused on more profound digital transformations, where WCM is a strategic technology to [create new business models](https://dri.es/business-model-innovation-beats-technical-innovation) and [build new digital experiences](https://dri.es/cross-channel-user-experiences-with-drupal).

Drupal is used for both. [Johnson &amp; Johnson](http://www.johnsonsbaby.com), [MillerCoors](http://www.millercoors.com) and [Motorola](http://www.motorola.com) are examples of brands that are creating digital experiences to support their marketing and communications. Look to the [City of Boston](https://dri.es/city-of-boston-launches-boston-gov-on-drupal)'s work to reimagine citizen engagement, or the innovation at [Hubert Burda Media](https://dri.es/thunder-a-drupal-distribution-for-publishers) to transform the publishing industry for the next digital age as examples of the latter.
