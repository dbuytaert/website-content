We already knew that [AOL was using Drupal](https://dri.es/aol-using-drupal) for their [AOL Developer Network](https://dri.es/aol-using-drupal) at [http://dev.aol.com](http://dev.aol.com/). Turns out that AOL also started using Drupal for [their corporate information website](http://corp.aol.com) at <http://corp.aol.com>. Is AOL falling in love with Drupal?
