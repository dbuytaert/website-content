# Antwerpen Studentenstad using Drupal

[image drupal/antwerpen-studentenstad]

I started work on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) as a graduate student living in Antwerp. Drupal was just a little hobby project. Today, the Antwerp student organization is actually using Drupal on <http://www.antwerpenstudentenstad.be>. *Cool!*
