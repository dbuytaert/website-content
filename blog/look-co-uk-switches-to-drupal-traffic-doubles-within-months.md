Last week I met with [IPC Media](http://www.ipcmedia.com/) in London. With magazines like Nuts, NME, Marie Claire, Country Life and many more, IPC Media is one of the UK's leading publishers.

IPC Media recently converted [Look.co.uk](http://look.co.uk) from a bespoke ColdFusion platform to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) to reduce the site's maintenance cost. When I met with the team, they were very pleased with the fact that it only took a couple of months to redesign the site with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and to migrate all the existing content. But best of all, thanks to Drupal's SEO (*Search Engine Optimization*), traffic doubled since the site was relaunched in early January. A great example of how you can use Drupal to maximize the power of your website!

**Update:** two IPC Media employees respond in the comments and provide some extra color; [Peter Brady](https://dri.es/look-co-uk-switches-to-drupal-traffic-doubles-within-months#comment-22196) (lead developer look.co.uk) and [Anthony Thornton](https://dri.es/look-co-uk-switches-to-drupal-traffic-doubles-within-months#comment-22241) (project manager look.co.uk).
