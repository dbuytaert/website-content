# FOSDEM 2008: call for speakers

Mark your agendas because the [Drupal project](https://www.drupal.org) got a 200-person developer room at FOSDEM on Sunday, February 24th. [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/), which stands for *Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting*, is a yearly free and non-commercial event for the open source community, held in Brussels (Belgium). With more than 3,000 attendees coming from all over the world, FOSDEM is the biggest open source event in Europe.

We will use the developer room to meet, discuss, and talk about Drupal. Right now, we're looking for speakers so let us know in the comments if you want to give a presentation. Alternatively, feel free to request presentation topics as well. [Joeri Poesen](http://symbiotix.net/) from [Krimson](http://krimson.be) is the lead schedule wrestler.
