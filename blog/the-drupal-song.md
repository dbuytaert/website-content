# The Drupal song

[Jeff Robbins](https://dri.es/jeff-boris-and-me), co-founder of [Lullabot](https://lullabot.com) and former lead singer of [Orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_%28band%29) wrote us [Drupal song](https://www.lullabot.com/audiocast/the_drupal_song) ([mirror](https://dri.es/files/the-drupal-song.mp3))! *Drupal, Drupal, Drupal, Drupal, Dru-pal!*

Now, let's record a video [this week at Yahoo!](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo) and upload it to [Sony's Musicbox](https://dri.es/sony-using-drupal). ;-)
