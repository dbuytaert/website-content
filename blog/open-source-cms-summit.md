In little over a week, I'll be speaking about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) at the Open Source CMS Summit, a conference for people interested in Open Source Content Management Systems. The conference takes place February 7 - 9 in Vancouver (Canada), right before Moose Camp and Northern Voice. Among people from the Plone, ezPublish, TikiWiki and the WordPress community, more than 100 Drupal contributors have registered. Yes, more than 100. *Utterly surreal!*
