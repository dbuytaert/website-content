# Mass Drupal hosting

Taken from [this press release](https://www.yahoo.com/news/s/nm/20061211/bs_nm/internet_wikia_dc_1) at News Yahoo!:

> Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said on Monday his for-profit company, Wikia Inc., is ready to give away – for free – all the software, computing, storage and network access that website builders need to create community collaboration sites.

The press release mentions that [Wikia](http://www.wikia.com) considers including support for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). I have since talked briefly to [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimbo_Wales), and they would like to reach out to the Drupal community and Drupal experts to help figure out how they can make that happen ...

As web content management systems and blogging tools become commodity, mass hosting and deployment services (i.e. installation, configuration, upgrading, patching, cloning, import and export, backup and restore, customization, compliance tracking, etc) will become increasingly important.

We already started taking Drupal into that direction, and [much of that](/drupal-distributions) will be rolled out with Drupal 5. ;-) There is a tremendous amount of experience to be gained, but also a significant amount of Drupal work left to be done. I'm looking forward to help work on this more and I hope other people do too. *Hot stuff!*
