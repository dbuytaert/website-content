# David's Drupal book in the mail

David Mercer has written a Drupal book: [Drupal: creating blogs, forums, portals, and community websites](https://www.packtpub.com/drupal/book/). The book is published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/), who mailed me a number of free copies to give away at future Drupal events.

It looks like a thorough book with clear and useful examples. The book is geared towards people who are new to Drupal and that want practical advice on how to get a Drupal site up and running. It won't make you a Drupal expert, but it will give you a solid base from which to build. More information, including a [free chapter on how to install Drupal](https://www.packtpub.com/files/Drupal_SampleChapter.pdf), can be found at the [publisher's website](https://www.packtpub.com/drupal/book/).
