# Sun on Drupal

[Sun Microsystems](http://sun.com) continues to develop a healthy interest in Drupal – witness this [video interview with Sun's Scott Mattoon](http://blogs.sun.com/SDNChannel/entry/what_makes_drupal_special). The video interview was taped back in October 2007, so Scott [shared some updates on his blog](http://blogs.sun.com/downstream/entry/drupal_waits_for_none). *Rock on Scott!*

We're fortunate enough that [Sun has a been long term Drupal contributor](https://dri.es/sun-and-drupal) and [an active Drupal user](https://dri.es/sun-using-drupal). They are even a [gold sponsor](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org/sponsor-list) for the [upcoming DrupalCon Boston](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org).*Thanks Sun!*
