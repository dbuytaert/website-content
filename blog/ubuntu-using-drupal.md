The popular Linux distribution [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28Linux_distribution%29), is now using Drupal at [https://www.ubuntu.com/](http://ubuntu.com). [More information](https://www.bearfruit.org/2007/03/14/the-new-ubuntu-website/) is available at [Matt Nazum's blog](https://www.bearfruit.org/blog/). I've mailed with [Matt](https://www.bearfruit.org/) about this and he wrote: <q>Now that we have a good platform, the fun is just beginning</q>. *Right on!*
