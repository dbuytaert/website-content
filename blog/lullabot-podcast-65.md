# Lullabot podcast #65

I was featured on the [infamous Lullabot podcast series](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts). Jeff Robbins and I talk about [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), [Mollom](https://mollom.com) and Drupal 7. Check out [the Lullabot podcast #65](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/dries-buytaert-acquia-and-mollom) ([mirror](https://dri.es/files/lullabot-podcast-65.mp3)) if you want. We kick it off talking about [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), the [Mollom](https://mollom.com) part starts around minute 25 and the Drupal part starts around minute 47.
