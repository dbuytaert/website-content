[Henri Bergius](http://bergie.iki.fi) has integrated [Mollom](https://mollom.com) into the [Midgard](http://www.midgard-project.org) open source content management framework. From [Henri's release announcement](https://bergie.iki.fi/blog/midgard-now_with_spam_filtering/): <q>When enabled, all posts sent to Midgard either on-site or using the email import tools will be passed to Mollom for assessment. If Mollom finds them spam or ham, they will be moderated accordingly. This should save a lot of time policing the site.</q>

Midgard provides an object-oriented platform for building data-intensive applications, and ships with its own content management system built on the Midgard framework. Its CMS solution features an interface for installing components that provide additional functionality, like Mollom's spam-filtering web service. The Mollom component will be available in the soon-to-be-released [Midgard 8.09.3 version](http://midgard-project.org/updates/midgard_8-09-3rc2_released). *Thanks Henri!*
