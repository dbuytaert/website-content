Congratulations to two of my best friends, Klaas and Joke, for [selling their company, Inventive Designers](https://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/ict/unifiedpost-lijft-bij-nieuwe-overname-antwerps-bedrijf-in/10074753.html). The sale is a great outcome for Inventive Designer's customers, partners and employees. This sale also means I will no longer serve on Inventive Designer's Board of Directors. I'll miss our board meetings, but I'm sure Klaas, Joke and I will replace them with nights in a local bar. *Congratulations, Klaas and Joke!*
