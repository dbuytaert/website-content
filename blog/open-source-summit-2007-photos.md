I just processed and uploaded a number of photos that I shot at the [Open Source CMS Summit at Yahoo!](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo). With more than 250 Drupal developers attending, this year's OSCMS Summit was simply overwhelming.

Take a look at [the photo gallery](https://dri.es/album/drupalcon-sunnyvale-2007/) to get to know some of the faces behind Drupal. *Thanks Yahoo!*
