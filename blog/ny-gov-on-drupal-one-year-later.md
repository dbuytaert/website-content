The web has done wonders to make government more accessible to its citizens. Take the State of New York; [NY.gov](http://ny.gov) is a perfect example of taking a people-centric approach to digital government. The site lets people easily access state government news and services, including real-time public transit updates, employment resources, healthcare information, and more.

One year ago, The State of New York redesigned and relaunched their website on [Drupal](https://drupal.com) in partnership with [Code and Theory](http://www.codeandtheory.com/) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com). Today, one year later, they've nearly tripled the audience to more than 6 million users. The most-visited part of the site is the services section, which aligns well with the governor's priority to provide better customer service to state residents. Annual page views have quadrupled since launch to a record high of more than 17 million and mobile usage has increased 275 percent.

For more details, check out the [press release](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-record-breaking-growth-first-anniversary-new-nygov-website) that the State of New York published today.
