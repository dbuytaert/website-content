# Linux Format reviews Drupal 4.7

In the January 2007 issue, [Linux Format](http://www.linuxformat.com/) reviewed Drupal 4.7 and compared it to [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/), [Mambo](https://www.mamboserver.com/), [Midgard](http://midgard-project.org/), [Plone](https://plone.org/) and [Typo3](https://typo3.org/). The information is not always 100% accurate, but it certainly makes for a good starting point if you're looking for a CMS.
