# Paula's teddy bear

[image miscellaneous-2006/paula-teddy]

Ironically, my Nikon D70 died when I was at that graveyard. The thumb wheel at the back of the camera stopped working and the exposure is often incorrect. I can't afford to buy a new camera so I'm going to send it to Nikon for repair. This is the second time my Nikon D70 broke; last time it took 9 weeks and 195 € to repair. We'll see what happens but it looks like I won't be able to take or share pictures for a couple of months. Such is life.
