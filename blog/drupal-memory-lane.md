I was recently interviewed by Janani Gopalakrishnan for the July 2007 issue of [Linux For You](http://www.linuxforu.com/), the leading Linux and Open Source magazine in India.

*Call it a web application platform, a content management system, a blogging engine, a bulletin board system, or a 'community plumbing' framework (as the team loves to call it), there is no denying that Drupal, now in avatar 5.1, is spreading its wings across the Web rather swiftly. We travel down memory lane with its founder and creator Dries Buytaert to the days of drop.org, and travel forth with him through its evolution into the popular Drupal.*

It was an extremely fun [interview ](https://dri.es/files/linux-for-u-interview.pdf)and as we progressed good memories came roaring right back. From the early days when Drupal was nothing more than an internal message board, to the first real Drupal conference in 2005.
