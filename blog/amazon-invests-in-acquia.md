I'm happy to share news that [Amazon](http://amazon.com) has joined the [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) family as our newest investor. This investment builds on the [recent $50 million financing round](https://dri.es/acquia-raises-50-million-series-f) that Acquia completed in May, which was led by [New Enterprise Associates](http://nea.com) (NEA).

Acquia is the largest provider of Drupal infrastructure in the world. We run on more than 8,000 AWS instances and serve more than 27 billion hits a month or 333 TB of bandwidth a month. Working with AWS has been an invaluable part of our success story, and today's investment will further [solidify our collaboration](https://mjskok.com/news/partnership-its-best-mutual-and-customer-driven).

We did not disclose the amount of the investment in today's news announcement.
