# NowPublic flirts with ABC News

Last week, [NowPublic](http://nowpublic.com/) redesigned once more. They just keep getting better! If you don't know NowPublic, it is a Drupal website that is a combination of Slashdot, Digg and Flickr (albeit not as popular yet). Every user can help report the news, provide valuable information, footage, context and insight.

What is more? As of this week, [ABC News](http://ABC.com) and NowPublic started to flirt by sharing some footage. That is good news because every other day, news organizations around the planet announce that they are going to take a similar approach and [tap into the wisdom of crowds](/traditional-media-and-citizen-journalism).
