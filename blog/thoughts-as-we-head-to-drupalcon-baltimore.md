# Thoughts as we head to DrupalCon Baltimore

The past weeks have been difficult. I'm well aware that the community is struggling, and it really pains me. I respect the various opinions expressed, including opinions different from my own. I want you to know that I'm listening and that I'm carefully considering the different aspects of this situation. I'm doing my best to progress through the issues and support the work that needs to happen to [evolve our governance model](https://dri.es/next-steps-for-evolving-drupal-governance). For those that are attending DrupalCon Baltimore and want to help, we just added a [community discussions track](https://events.drupal.org/baltimore2017/community-discussion).

There is a lot to figure out, and I know that it's difficult when there are unresolved questions. Leading up to DrupalCon Baltimore next week, it may be helpful for people to know that Larry Garfield and I are talking. As members of the Community Working Group reported this week, [Larry remains a member of the community](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qlc0FvM4UWyn4DpW8JKRcVqnHAIdrj2INOZZF62s_Pc//edit). While we figure out Larry's future roles, Larry is attending DrupalCon as a regular community member with the opportunity to participate in sessions, code sprints and issue queues.

As we are about to kick off DrupalCon Baltimore, please know that my wish for this conference is for it to be everything you've made it over the years; a time for bringing out the best in each other, for learning and sharing our knowledge, and for great minds to work together to move the project forward. We owe it to the 3,000 people who will be in attendance to make DrupalCon about Drupal. To that end, I ask for your patience towards me, so I can do my part in helping to achieve these goals. It can only happen with your help, support, patience and understanding. Please join me in making DrupalCon Baltimore an amazing time to connect, collaborate and learn, like the many DrupalCons before it.

*(I have received a lot of comments and at this time I just want to respond with an update. I decided to close the comments on this post.)*
