I received a plaque on behalf of the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org). Why? Because we made it to EContent's list of the top 100 organizations that matter most in the digital content industry. More information at the [EContent 100 website](http://www.econtentmag.com/Archives/ArchiveIssue.aspx?IssueId=490). It is always great to see our outstanding work being recognized. *Good work team!*
