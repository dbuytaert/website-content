[Video2brain](https://www.video2brain.com/) sent me a copy of the [Drupal 5 training video](https://www.video2brain.com/products-106.htm) they recorded with [Hagen Graf](https://dri.es/album/drupalcon-brussels-2006/hagen-graf), author of a [German Drupal book](https://dri.es/german-addison-wesley-drupal-book). The video is in German so I can't evaluate the quality of the content, but it sure looks professional. If your German is better than mine, you can get some [free video samples](https://www.video2brain.com/products-106.htm) from their website. And for every copy they sell, 1.25 EUR goes back to the Drupal project. *Sehr cool!*
