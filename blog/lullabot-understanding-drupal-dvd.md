I finally had some time to take out my copy of [Lullabot's Understanding Drupal DVD](https://store.lullabot.com/collections/frontpage/products/understanding-drupal) for a quick photo shoot. This DVD provides a broad overview of Drupal, and covers all the terminology and fundamental concepts of a Drupal site. It is great for people that are new to Drupal. For people that have Drupal experience, it might be too introductory, but those should certainly wait for the next DVD in their series.

Lullabot also promised to make a donation to the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org) for every copy sold. *Thanks 'bots!*
