# Pink using Drupal

[image drupal/pink]

Pink is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for [her official website](http://www.pinkspage.com/). She also began using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect her site's content, and we've blocked thousands of spam attempts since. The site was built by her label [Sony BMG](http://sonybmg.com). *Yay!*

Call me soft, but my favorite Pink song is "I have seen the rain", a song written by her father while he was stationed in Vietnam. You can watch the YouTube video below ...
