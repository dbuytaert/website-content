On 07/07/07, Drupal contributer [Noel Noneck](http://noneck.org) left New York City for a 7 month journey around the 7 continents of the world with a budget of $7,777 USD.

One of the goals of his journey, affably named [The Luck of Seven](http://luckofseven.com), is to document Free and Open Source Software – and the Drupal story in particular.

Armed with a set of cameras, Noel wants to profile the [Drupal community](https://www.drupal.org) through stories, photos, videos and ultimately, a documentary movie released in 2008. He is donating 25% of the profits to the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org).
