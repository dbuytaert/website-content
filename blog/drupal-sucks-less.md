# Drupal sucks less

> All content management systems suck, [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) just happens to suck less. – [Boris Mann](https://www.bmannconsulting.com/) at DrupalCON Amsterdam, August 2005.

Almost a year later, I still think that Boris nailed it. We have a long way to go if we want to make it easy for (non-technical) people to create and maintain advanced websites.
