Ever wondered how spammers can be profitable? According to [this BBC article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7719281.stm), researchers have calculated that those sending unsolicited e-mails can make a profit by attracting just one sale from every 12.5 million spam e-mails sent. Even though their conversion rates are well under 0.00001%, big spam networks generate more than $3.5 million USD in annual revenue. All it takes is thousands of hijacked machines sending hundreds of millions of spam messages a day. More details in [the original research paper](http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/2008-ccs-spamalytics.pdf) (PDF) by Chris Kanich et al. *Crazy!*
