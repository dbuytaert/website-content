# Niagara Falls by night

[image niagara-on-the-lake-2017/niagara-falls-by-night-1]

I had a chance to visit the Niagara Falls last week on a family trip. If you like nature, it's a must see – both during the day and at night when they lit up the falls. I love this photo but it still doesn't capture the majesty and beauty of the Niagara Falls.
