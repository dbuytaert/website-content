# Announcing the Drupal Starshot Advisory Council

[image drupal/starshot-council schema=false]

I'm excited to announce the formation of the Drupal Starshot Advisory Council. When I [announced Starshot's Leadership Team](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-starshot-leadership-team), I explained that we are innovating on the leadership model by adding a team of advisors. This council will provide strategic input and feedback to help ensure [Drupal Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot) meets the needs of key stakeholders and end-users.

The Drupal Starshot initiative represents an ambitious effort to expand Drupal's reach and impact. To guide this effort, we've established a diverse Advisory Council that includes members of the Drupal Starshot project team, Drupal Association staff and Board of Directors, representatives from Drupal Certified Partners, Drupal Core Committers, and last but not least, individuals representing the target end-users for Drupal Starshot. This ensures a wide range of perspectives and expertise to inform the project's direction and decision-making.

The initial members include:

- [Imre Gmelig Meijling](https://www.drupal.org/u/imre-gmelig-meijling), React Online / Drupal Association Board - Fundraising Committee
- [Suzanne Dergachev](https://www.drupal.org/u/pixelite), Evolving Web / Drupal Association Board - Marketing Committee
- [Mike Herchel](https://www.drupal.org/u/mherchel), Agileana / Drupal Association Board - Innovation Committee
- [Tim Doyle](https://www.drupal.org/u/tim-d), CEO at the Drupal Association
- [Tim Lehnen](https://www.drupal.org/u/hestenet), CTO at the Drupal Association
- [Kristen Pol](https://www.drupal.org/u/kristen-pol), Salsa Digital - Drupal Certified Partner representative
- [Chris Yates](https://www.drupal.org/u/chrisyates), Pantheon - Drupal Certified Partner representative
- [Luis Ribeiro](https://www.drupal.org/u/luisr), CI&amp;T - Drupal Certified Partner representative
- [Kathryn Carruthers](https://www.drupal.org/u/kathc), alakasam - End User representative
- [Emma Horrell](https://www.drupal.org/u/emma-horrell), University of Edinburgh - End User representative
- [Nathaniel Catchpole (catch), Third and Grove / Tag1 Consulting](https://www.drupal.org/u/catch) - Drupal Core Committer
- [Théodore Biadala (nod\_)](https://www.drupal.org/u/nod_), Très Bien Tech - Drupal Core Committer

The council has been meeting monthly to receive updates from myself and the Drupal Starshot Leadership Team. Members will provide feedback on project initiatives, offer recommendations, and share insights based on their diverse experiences and areas of expertise.

In addition to guiding the strategic direction of Drupal Starshot, the Advisory Council will play a vital role in communication and alignment between the Drupal Starshot team, the Drupal Association, Drupal Core, and the broader Drupal community.

I'm excited to be working with this accomplished group to make the Drupal Starshot vision a reality. Together we can expand the reach and impact of Drupal, and continue advancing our mission to make the web a better place.
