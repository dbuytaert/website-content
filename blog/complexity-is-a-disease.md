The [Ockham's Razor Principle of Content Management Systems](https://dri.es/ockhams-razor-principle-of-content-management-systems) says that given two functionally equivalent content management systems, the simplest one will be chosen. It asserts that simplicity is preferred to complexity. As content management systems become more alike in terms of critical functionality, ease of use will become a key differentiator (rather then functionality).

In addition, web application frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), whose goal is to develop applications with as little code as possible, are redefining the rules of how websites are built. For web application developers, ease of development will become a key differentiator.

Hackability is key.

Complexity is a disease.

Making Drupal (i) easier to use, (ii) easier to develop for, and (iii) easier to theme – while maintaining its functionality and flexibility – is what I'll be working on.
