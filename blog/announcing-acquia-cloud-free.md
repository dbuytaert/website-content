# Announcing Acquia Cloud Free

I'm excited to announce that Acquia is launching [Acquia Cloud Free](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud-free), a no-cost development sandbox for Drupal development. While Acquia has always had a freemium offer for development purposes, it had an expiration date, and it required a credit card. We've changed that with Acquia Cloud Free. Acquia Cloud Free comes packed with great tools including, but not limited to:

1. A free development sandbox on [Acquia Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud) with development and staging environments, [Drush](https://www.drupal.org/project/drush) integration, Git repository and more. (The sandbox can't be used to run production sites.)
2. Drupal development workflow tools that allow you to deploy code between dev and staging environments, replicate files, make backups and more.
3. [Acquia Insight](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-cloud) which will scan your site for security problems, performance improvements and general Drupal best practices. Every day, we run thousands of tests on your site. Our team keeps adding new tests based on what they learn every day.
4. [Acquia Search](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-platform) which supercharges your site's search capabilities with more accurate search results, faceted navigation, search analytics and more.

We've put a lot of thought and effort into creating the Acquia Cloud platform and continue to invest it in heavily. As a result, we have seen [tremendous adoption](https://dri.es/growth-of-acquia-cloud). I believe that giving everyone access to a free Acquia Cloud development sandbox is one way we can give back and help grow Drupal. *Give it a try if you want!*
