# One million spam attempts blocked

Last weekend, just 3 weeks after [we launched Mollom](https://dri.es/mollom-my-content-monitoring-startup), [Mollom](https://mollom.com) has blocked the one millionth spam attempt. That is a million tiny contributions to make the web a nicer place. Incidentally, [Mollom also got mentioned on Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/20/mollom-may-soon-offer-serious-competition-to-akismet/) that same weekend. *Milestone weekend!*
