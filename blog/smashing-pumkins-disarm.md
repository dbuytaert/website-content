Another post in [my favorite music series](https://dri.es/tag/favorite-music). This time, a song from the [Smashing Pumpkins](http://www.smashingpumpkins.com/), a band that I listened to a lot in the formative years of my youth. [Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellon_Collie_and_the_Infinite_Sadness) was one of the very first albums that I ever bought. Many people loathe Billy Corgan's voice, but to me, his voice is what makes the Smashing Pumpkins so unique – even today.
