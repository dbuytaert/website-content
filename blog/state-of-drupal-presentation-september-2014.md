I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation this week at DrupalCon Amsterdam. I decided to talk about the sustainability and scalability of the Drupal community. In case you didn't attend DrupalCon Amsterdam, you can [watch the recording of my keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NN5EM4CYVE), [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2014.pdf) (PDF, 17 MB) or [read my blog post on the topic](https://dri.es/scaling-open-source-communities).
