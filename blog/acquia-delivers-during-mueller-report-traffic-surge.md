Last month, [Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-awaited report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_Report) on Russian interference in the U.S. election was released on the [Justice.gov](https://www.justice.gov) website.

With the help of [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), the report was successfully delivered without interruption, despite a 7,000% increase in traffic on its release date, according to [the Ottawa Business Journal](https://obj.ca/article/why-drupal-matters).

According to [Federal Computer Week](https://fcw.com/articles/2019/04/22/doj-mueller-traffic-spike.aspx), by 5pm on the day of the report's release, there had already been 587 million site visits, with 247 million happening within the first hour.

During these types of high-pressure events when the world is watching, no news is good news. Keeping sites like this up and available to the public is an important part of democracy and the freedom of information. I'm proud of Acquia's and Drupal's ability to deliver when it matters most!
