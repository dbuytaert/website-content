This year in [my keynote at DrupalCon San Francisco](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-april-2010), I mentioned that the elephants are coming. Well, earlier this week [Capgemini](http://capgemini.com), one of the world's foremost consulting providers with 95,000 employees, announced a new service, [Capgemini Immediate](http://immediate.capgemini.com). I'm pleased to say that they're using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) as a foundational technology for their new *Immediate* platform.

Capgemini Immediate is an offering which helps organizations to build and run on-line services. It consists of a number of preferred technologies (i.e., Drupal, MySQL, Salesforce, Lithium, etc.), best practices, and [an ecosystem of preferred partners](http://immediate.capgemini.com/partners.php) of which [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) is part.

Capgemini Immediate is already being well received and making news. The [Royal Mail](http://www.royalmail.com), the national postal service of the United Kingdom, has signed a large six-year IT contract with Capgemini to transform their on-line services using Capgemini Immediate. With almost 200,000 employees, Royal Mail is the second biggest employer in the UK. Signing of Royal Mail received significant press coverage, including the Wall Street Journal.

The Capgemini stamp of approval, and the fact that Royal Mail will be using Drupal, is tremendous news for all of us. This could be a very important milestone in the history of Drupal – similar to when Dell and IBM decided to ship machines with Linux pre-installed in 2007.

Incidentally, Capgemini is using Drupal to power their own 95,000 person intranet.
