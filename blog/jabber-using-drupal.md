I've been meaning to blog about this for months. So in case you haven't noticed yet, our friends at [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org) are using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for [jabber.org](http://www.jabber.org). They are also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect their website against spam.

I still want [my Drupal to talk to my Jabber](https://dri.es/twitter-drupal-and-jabber). Think "Drupal → Mollom → Jabber/XMPP → instant messaging client" to get notifications about new comments or other important events, for a example. Lots of other XMPP-Drupal opportunities as well ...
