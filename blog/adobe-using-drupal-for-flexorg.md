# Adobe using Drupal for flex.org

[Adobe](http://adobe.com) just relaunched [flex.org](http://flex.org) as a [Drupal site](https://www.drupal.org). The backend of the Flex powered showcase site, <http://flex.org/showcase>, is also using Drupal: it communicates with the Flex front-end using the [Services](https://www.drupal.org/project/services) and the [AMFPHP modules](https://www.drupal.org/project/amfphp). More information available on [the Adobe Flex Team blog](http://blogs.adobe.com/flex/archives/2008/07/introducing_the_new_flexorg.html). They are using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) too.
