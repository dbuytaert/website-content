# Teaching my son how the web works

For the first time, I taught my twelve year old son some HTML and CSS. This morning after breakfast we sat down and created a basic HTML page with some simple styling.

I explained to him that `<a>` is the most powerful HTML tag of them all ...

It was a special experience for both of us. It looks like I sparked his interest as later he asked where he can learn about different HTML tags. I loved that he shared an interest to learn more.

But it also made me think that rather than just teach him HTML and CSS syntax, I want to help him develop an appreciation for how the web works. I'll have to think about how to best explain concepts like HTTP, DNS, IP addresses, and maybe even TCP.
