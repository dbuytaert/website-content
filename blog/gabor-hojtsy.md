Two months ago I invited [Gábor Hojtsy](http://hojtsy.hu/) to become a co-maintainer of Drupal 6, the next major Drupal version.

As of today, Gábor can commit patches to Drupal's development branch and for the duration of one release cycle, he will help [Steven Wittens](http://acko.net/) and myself to shape the face of the next Drupal version by identifying and coordinating interesting development efforts put forward by the Drupal community.

The main reasons for putting Gábor in this role include his work on [localization](https://groups.drupal.org/translations) and [internationalization](https://groups.drupal.org/i18n), his active involvement in the [Hungarian Drupal community](http://drupal.hu), his background with the [PHP documentation team](https://www.php.net/docs.php), and the consistent stream of high-quality contributions over time.

Having a dedicated maintainer for each major Drupal release has proven to be extremely valuable so I'm hopeful that this decision will be one of my best decisions in months.
