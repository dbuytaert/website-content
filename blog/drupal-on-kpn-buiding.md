# Drupal on KPN building

How crazy can it get? In celebration of the [Drupal 7 release](https://dri.es/drupal-7-released), Druplicon is featured on the [KPN](http://kpn.com) building in Rotterdam from Wednesday January 5th until Saturday January 8th. *Thanks [SqyD](https://www.drupal.org/user/106525) and [d7ra.org](http://d7ra.org)!*
