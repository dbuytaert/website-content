[TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com) [reports](https://techcrunch.com/2007/05/29/greatful-dead-fan-site-reborn-as-social-network/) that the [Grateful Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grateful_dead) website is about to be relaunched as a Drupal website:

> The new version of [Dead.net](http://dead.net) was created on the Drupal content management platform and features extensive archives cataloging Grateful Dead history, songs, photos, memorabilia, and shows, indexed and searchable by tags. Dead users will be able to participate in forums, upload their own photos, and bookmark concerts and shows they have attended. Fans will also be treated to exclusive free mp3 show downloads.
