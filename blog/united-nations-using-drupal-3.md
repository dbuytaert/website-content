# United Nations using Drupal

117 million people participated in the [United Nations' Anti-Poverty event](http://www.standagainstpoverty.org), and it was organized on a Drupal site: <https://www.standagainstpoverty.org/>.

Nearly 117 million people – close to 2 per cent of the world's population – took part in events all around the world to stand up and take action against poverty and for the [Millennium Development Goals](http://www.endpoverty2015.org/goals). According to a [United Nations' press release](https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/10/279062-record-breaking-117-million-people-stand-un-against-poverty) they broke the Guinness World Record for the largest social mobilization ever on a single issue. Furthermore, the United Nations unveiled that they secured around [$16 billion in new commitments](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=28276) to meet the [Millennium Development Goals](http://www.endpoverty2015.org/goals).

The [Stand Up Against Poverty site](https://www.standagainstpoverty.org/) was developed by the great folks at [Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org); and as you can tell from [their blog post](https://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2008/oct/22/united-nations-uses-drupal-huge-anti-poverty-event/), they pushed the Drupal envelope once again.

It is great to help make a product that many people like, but it is even better when that product helps improve the world a little bit!
