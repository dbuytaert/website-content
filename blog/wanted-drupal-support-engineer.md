# Wanted: Drupal support engineer

One of the things we're building at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) is a *Drupal technical support center* where customers can call for help with Drupal questions. We're busy setting up a phone system, a bug tracker, a customer tracking application, a knowledge base and more. We already have some great technical support people on board, but we're looking for more Drupal talent to staff our support center.

Specifically, we're looking for people that have the rare combination of *mad Drupal skills* (both Drupal configuration and Drupal development), a diagnostic mind, and what we call, the *support DNA*. Do you have what it takes and do you want to learn how to build a support center from scratch? [Apply here](https://www.acquia.com/jobs/technical-support).

Or be the first to refer someone who makes the cut, and we'll gladly mail you a check for $1,000 USD to $2,500 USD depending on the situation. See [our technical support job page](https://www.acquia.com/jobs/technical-support) for details on our bounty program.
