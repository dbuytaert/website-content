Growing up my dad had a watch from [TAG Heuer](https://www.tagheuer.com). As a young child, I always admired his watch and wished that one day I'd have one as well. I still don't have a TAG Heuer watch, however I just found out that [TAG Heuer](https://www.tagheuer.com) relaunched its website using Drupal 8 and that is pretty cool too.

TAG Heuer's new website integrates Drupal 8 with their existing Magento commerce platform to provide a better, more content-rich shopping experience. It is a nice example of the ["Content for Commerce"-opportunity](https://dri.es/content-and-commerce-a-big-opportunity-for-drupal) that I wrote about a month ago. Check it out at <https://www.tagheuer.com>!
