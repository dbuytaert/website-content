Today we are announcing that [Chris Tranquill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctranq/) has been appointed CEO of [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/), succeeding [Steve Reny](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-reny-0a2a0a163/). Steve will be stepping down after nearly seven years with Acquia, including almost three as CEO.

I feel a mix of emotions. Sadness, because Steve has been a valued leader and colleague. Gratitude, for everything he has done for Acquia and our community. Optimism, because he is leaving Acquia in a strong position. And happiness, knowing he has been looking forward to spending more time with his family and dedicating himself to giving back after an incredible 40-year career.

Steve worked incredibly hard, cared deeply about customers, and built genuine relationships with so many people across the company. Under his leadership, Acquia became more efficient, launched new products, strengthened its Open Source commitment, and grew with financial discipline. He created a strong foundation for our future, and I want to sincerely thank him for his leadership.

At the same time, I am very excited to welcome Chris Tranquill as our new CEO. Chris brings more than 25 years of experience in enterprise software and customer experience. Most recently he was CEO of Khoros, and before that he co-founded Topbox, which was later acquired by Khoros.

In our conversations, I was impressed by how quickly Chris understood our business, the thoughtful questions he asked, and his enthusiasm for our innovation roadmap. I also appreciate that he has been a founder and brings that perspective. Most importantly, he recognized right away how essential Drupal is to Acquia's success.

Some in the Drupal community may wonder what this leadership change means for Acquia's commitment to Drupal and Open Source. The answer is simple: our commitment remains unchanged. One of the reasons we chose Chris is because he understands that Drupal's success is essential to Acquia's success.

Today, Acquia is investing more in Drupal than at any time in our 18-year history, with record numbers of contributors and active involvement in many of Drupal's most important initiatives. We are proud to contribute alongside the community. Supporting Drupal is core to who we are, and that will not change.

I am grateful for Steve's leadership, and I look forward to working with Chris!
