# Acquia featured in the Boston Globe

[Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) was featured in today's Boston Globe. The article, titled [Start-up built on free software](https://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2009/05/26/start_up_built_on_free_software/), talks about the growing interest in Open Source during tough economic times. The Boston Globe is a daily newspaper based in Boston, owned by The New York Times Company, with an average circulation of 350,000. *Nice!*
