After a lot of discussion and testing, we decided to adopt the [Aloha Editor](http://aloha-editor.org) as the WYSIWYG editor for [Spark](https://dri.es/tag/spark-distribution), and possibly for Drupal 8 core. Check out [Wim's blog for the details](https://wimleers.com/blog/spark-update-wysiwyg-choice). In short, it is the best HTML5 based WYSIWYG editor; fast, well-written and future-proof.

Here is a screenshot of our latest designs of how we envision integrating the Aloha Editor in Spark on a mobile device:

I also wanted to give a big thank you to [Haymo Meran](https://twitter.com/draftkraft), creator of Aloha Editor and Director of Product Experience at [Gentics Software GmbH](https://www.gentics.com/), both for hosting a [Drupal/Aloha collaboration sprint](https://wimleers.com/blog/aloha-drupal-spark-sprint-report) at his company's offices in Vienna last month, and also for [changing the license of Aloha Editor](https://www.alohaeditor.org/license.php) to GPLv2+ (from AGPLv3) so that it could be used with [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org)!

It's an incredible gift to the Drupal project and the Open Source community at large. *Thanks!*
