Through a [presentation from Nicole Sullivan](https://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/designing-fast-websites-presentation), a former member of Yahoo's Exceptional Performance Team and co-author of O'Reilly's upcoming book on performance optimization, I came across the following data points:

- Amazon: 100 ms of extra load time caused a 1% drop in sales. (Source: [Greg Linden, Amazon)](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html)
- Google: 500 ms of extra load time caused 20% fewer searches. (Source: [Marrissa Mayer, Google](https://www.cnet.com/news/were-all-guinea-pigs-in-googles-search-experiment/))
- Google: trimming page size by 30% resulted in 30% more map requests. (Source: [Marrissa Mayer, Google](https://www.cnet.com/news/were-all-guinea-pigs-in-googles-search-experiment/))
- Yahoo!: 400 ms of extra load time caused a 5 to 9% increase in the number of people that clicked "back" before the page even loaded. (Source: [Nicole Sullivan, Yahoo!](https://www.slideshare.net/stubbornella/designing-fast-websites-presentation))

While we all knew this was true (and while I'd like more detail on these tests), it is nice to have some quantitative data from different sources. Long story short: even the smallest delay kills user satisfaction. (Hat tip: [Peter Van Dijck](http://petervandijck.com))
