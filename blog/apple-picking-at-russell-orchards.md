# Apple picking at Russell Orchards

We had our very first apple picking experience today. We went to [Russell Orchards](https://www.russellorchards.com/) and saw a 1,000 pound pig (no kidding, the biggest pig I have ever seen), picked apples, ate some amazing home-made cider donuts, played in the play garden and took a hayride. *Couldn't have been any nicer!*
