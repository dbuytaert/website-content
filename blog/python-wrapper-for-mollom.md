# Python wrapper for Mollom

[Andy Georges](http://itkovian.net) released a [Python wrapper for Mollom](http://itkovian.net/base/python-wrapper-mollom). The wrapper can be used to integrate Mollom in your Python applications, but it also gets Mollom one step closer to the [Django project](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

The [Mollom API](https://www.mollom.com/api) was released [less than 10 days ago](https://dri.es/mollom-api-now-available), and already [Mollom](https://mollom.com) is supported on PHP, Java, Python and Ruby. *Sweet!*
