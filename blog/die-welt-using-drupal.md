[Die Welt](https://www.welt.de/) (*The World*), a big German newspaper published by [Axel Springer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Springer_AG) recently started using Drupal at [Welt Debatte](http://blog.debatte.welt.de/).

[Talking about Bill Gates](https://dri.es/de-morgen-interview), their [second blog post](http://blog.debatte.welt.de/node/8) coincidentally talks about Bill Gates and Drupal – but in an informative way. They seem proud to be using Drupal.
