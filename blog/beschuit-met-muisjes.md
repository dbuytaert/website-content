# Beschuit met muisjes

[image miscellaneous-2010/beschuit-met-muisjes]

We spent the afternoon in Amsterdam visiting [the newborn Sebas](https://dri.es/album/miscellaneous-2010/sebas-snijder). The above is what the Dutch serve to celebrate the birth of a baby. Can you imagine?

It's called *"beschuit met muisjes"* (pronunciation: bəˈsxœyt mɛt ˈmœyʃəs, literal: "biscuits with little mice"). It is toast with butter and sugared anise seeds – a tradition that goes back to the 17th century.

In Flanders we celebrate the arrival of a newborn with *"suikerbonen"* or sugar beans, which are almonds with dark Belgian chocolate coated with a thin, hard layer of sugar. M&amp;Ms on steroids, if you will.
