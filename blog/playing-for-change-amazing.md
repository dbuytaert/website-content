# Playing for Change = amazing

[video Us-TVg40ExM]

This video will bring a smile on your face.

It is a cover of "Stand by me" recorded by completely unknown artists all around the world. It started with base tracks by a street musician called Roger Ridley. These tracks were then taken all over the world where other street artists added vocals and new instruments to it. All done with a simple laptop, some headphones and some microphones. They never met.

This song marked the start of what would become a global collaborative music movement. Today, everyone can participate by joining [Playing for Change](http://www.playingforchange.com). To date, [seven episodes have been recorded](https://playingforchange.com/episodes) and people are hosting screenings, musicians are holding benefit concerts of every size, fans are spreading the message. I wish I could play music (I can't) but maybe it will inspire some of you to join.

Sounds [familiar](https://www.drupal.org)? I thought so too ...
