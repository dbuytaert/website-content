The [Drupal Code of Conduct](https://www.drupal.org/dcoc), heavily borrowed from our friends at [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/), does an excellent job enshrining the characteristics we aim to foster, in order to ensure people "Come for the software, stay for the community". However, there are still some gaps. For example, how to deal with conflict resolution, and how an individual best goes about proposing new governance policies.

Key Drupal contributor Randy Fay has done a tremendous amount of research into governance models of other open source projects, which you can read more about [on his blog](https://randyfay.com/topics/governance). For those who have not been following Randy's posts, he and I are holding a sprint about Drupal Governance on July 16 and 17 in Portland, Oregon just after the [Community Leadership Summit](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/). Randy, Angela Byron, Greg Dunlap, David Strauss, and myself will be in attendance.

This sprint is a first for Drupal. The goal of this sprint is to come up with a proposal for subsequent community discussion with recommendations around some of the following topics:

1. Processes to create and maintain policies, as a general concept
2. A process for resolving technical conflicts
3. A process for resolving community/interpersonal conflicts
4. A process and team for resolving "nuclear" issues that need extremely delicate handling.

If you have other topics you'd like to propose, or would like to provide feedback on these items in advance of the sprint, please chime in in the [Governance project issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/governance). It is important work to streamline and evolve the governance of our project, so thanks in advance for your contributions.
