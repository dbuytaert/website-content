While distributed source code management tools like [Git](http://git.or.cz/), [Mercurial](https://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/), [Monotone](http://www.monotone.ca/) and [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/) ([which some Drupal developers use](http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Drupal/tips)) offer advantages over [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/) or [SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/), they are not as accessible or well-supported. Drupal developers and Drupal designers are not Linux kernel hackers, and for many of them CVS is the biggest barrier to entry. Without desktop integration for both Windows and the Mac (like [TurtoiseCVS](http://www.tortoisecvs.org/) or [MacCVSClient](http://www.heilancoo.net/MacCVSClient/) offer), I don't see how we can migrate away from CVS without leaving half of our community behind ...

Not to mention the fact that our entire release management system is built on top of CVS. It would be a lot of work to switch that to another system.
