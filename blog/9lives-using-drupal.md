# 9lives using Drupal

Belgium's biggest gaming site, [9lives](https://www.9lives.be/) (formerly known as *games.telenet.be*) [relaunched using Drupal](https://www.9lives.be/node/87180). They have 275,000 users and serve 500,000 page views a day. For their forums, they still use [vBulletin](https://www.vbulletin.com/) though.
