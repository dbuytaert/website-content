I received a free copy of the [Forrester report that compares blogging platforms](/forrester-reports-on-drupal) (including Drupal). *Thanks Forrester!*

The report is concise: it presents the final results of their comparison and formulates platform-independent recommendations for IT managers. Very useful but free of (interesting) details and nuances.

Fifteen pages, 995 USD, freed from many worries ... [add to cart](https://www.forrester.com/Research/Document/Excerpt/0,7211,37147,00.html).
