It appears that [André Gilain](http://gilain.be) who [interviewed me last year about Drupal](https://dri.es/trends-interview) for [Trends](http://www.trends.be), a fairly known Belgian business magazine has started using Drupal for [his personal blog](http://gilain.be). Did I redefine the term *successful interview*? ;)
