# DrupalCon Hungary

Just to add to the craziness: the weekend after [DrupalCon Brussels](/drupalcon-brussels), I'll be in Budapest to attend the [first Hungarian Drupal conference](https://www.drupal.hu/konferencia/2006). The conference takes place on the 30th of September, and brings together the key players of the Hungarian Drupal scene. All presentations are in Hungarian, except mine. (The one Hungarian word I know is "[gulyás](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulash)"; it makes for a good dinner but not exactly for a great presentation.) Registration is required prior to attendence, so sign up at the [DrupalCon Hungary website](https://www.drupal.hu/konferencia/2006).
