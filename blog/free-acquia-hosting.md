# Free Acquia Hosting

Last week at DrupalCon Paris, we announced [Acquia Hosting](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-managed-cloud), a highly available cloud-based hosting platform tuned for Drupal performance and scalability. Technical details can be found in my [announcement blog post](https://dri.es/acquia-hosting-now-available).

Today, we are happy to announce that we'll start to provide free Acquia Hosting accounts to *not for profit sites dedicated to promoting the adoption and usage of Drupal*. For example, DrupalCamp websites and local Drupal user group websites would qualify for free Acquia Hosting. The program starts in October or November, but [you can sign-up now](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-managed-cloud/free-acquia-hosting) if you have a site that qualifies.

In exchange for free hosting, we require that the footer section of each page displays *"Hosted by Acquia"*, and that an Acquia logo is displayed somewhere on your homepage.

If your site meets the above criterion, and you wish to enroll in Acquia's Free Hosting program, you can [sign up](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-managed-cloud/free-acquia-hosting) and we'll let you know when we are ready to host your site.
