Another U.S. government agency switched to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). This time, it is the U.S. Small Business Administration. As part of their mission to ensure that small business owners and entrepreneurs have access to accurate, timely and helpful information, the SBA relaunched their website in Drupal. Check it out at [SBA.gov](http://sba.gov).

The site was built by Promet Source and DRT Strategies (DRT).
