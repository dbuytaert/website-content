I received an interesting little book on blogging from [Skynet Blogs](http://www.skynetblogs.be/), a hosted weblog service in Belgium. I especially liked the market research and the statistics about the Belgian blogosphere. *Well done [Skynet](http://www.skynet.be/) and thanks [Clo](http://www.bnox.be/)!*
