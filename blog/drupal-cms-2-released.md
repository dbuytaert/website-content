# Drupal CMS 2.0 released

[image blog/drupal-cms-2-released priority=false schema=false]

Today we released Drupal CMS 2.0. I've been looking forward to this release for a long time!

If [Drupal is 25 years old](https://dri.es/25-years-of-drupal-what-i-have-learned), why only version 2.0? Because [Drupal Core](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal) is the same powerful platform you've known for years, now at version 11. [Drupal CMS](https://www.drupal.org/project/cms) is a product built on top of it, packaging best-practice solutions and extra features to help you get started faster.  It was launched a year ago as part of [Drupal Starshot](https://dri.es/introducing-drupal-starshot-product-strategy).

Why build this layer at all? Because the criticism has been fair: Drupal is powerful but not easy. For years, features like easier content editing and better page building have topped the wishlist.

Drupal CMS is changing Drupal's story from powerful but hard to powerful and easy to use.

With Drupal CMS 2.0, we're taking another big step forward. You no longer begin with a blank slate. You can begin with [site templates](https://dri.es/exploring-a-marketplace-for-drupal-site-templates) designed for common use cases, then shape them to fit your needs. You get a visual page builder, preconfigured content types, and a smoother editing experience out of the box. We also added more AI-powered features to help draft and refine content.

The biggest new feature in this release is [Drupal Canvas](https://dri.es/drupal-canvas-1-0-released), our new visual page builder that now ships by default with Drupal CMS 2.0. You can drag components onto a page, edit in place, and undo changes. No jumping between forms and preview screens.

WordPress and Webflow have shown how powerful visual editing can be. Drupal Canvas brings that same ease to Drupal with more power while keeping its strengths: custom content types, component-based layouts, granular permissions, and much more.

But Drupal Canvas is only part of the story. What matters more is how these pieces are starting to fit together, in line with the direction we set out more than a year ago: site templates to start from, a visual builder to shape pages, better defaults across the board, and AI features that help you get work done faster. It's the result of a lot of hard work by many people across the Drupal community.

If you tried Drupal years ago and found it too complex, I'd love for you to give it another look. Building a small site with a few landing pages, a campaign section, and a contact form used to take a lot of setup. With Drupal CMS 2.0, you can get something real up and running *much* faster than before.

For 25 years, Drupal traded ease for power and flexibility. That is finally starting to change, while keeping the power and flexibility that made Drupal what it is. Thank you to everyone who has been pushing this forward.
