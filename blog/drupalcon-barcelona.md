# DrupalCon Barcelona

![DrupalCon Barcelona](https://dri.es/files/images/drupal/drupalcon-barcelona-2007.jpg)

This post is long due but I'd like to invite everyone to join us at the next Drupal conference held in the [beautiful Barcelona](https://dri.es/album/barcelona-2005/) (Spain). It will be a 4-day conference from September 19-22, 2007. More information is available at the [DrupalCon Barcelona website](http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/).

Every year, we try to organize two main Drupal conferences; one hosted in Europe and one hosted in North-America. This year's North American event [took place at Yahoo!](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo), and now the European event will take place in Barcelona. (I'd love to do a third annual Drupal conference in Asia or South-America.)

Being one of the main Drupal events, DrupalCon Barcelona will bring together hundreds of Drupal users and developers from all around the world. Whether you are a Drupal professional or an enthusiastic user coming to find out more, you're invited to [join us in Barcelona](http://barcelona2007.drupalcon.org/).

Kudos to the [Catalan Drupal user group](http://www.drupal.cat/) and the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) for taking on the organizational work. It's great to see that others do a much better job organizing a Drupal conference than I ever did. For example, I don't think we ever managed to open registration three months before the conference when I was a (co-)organizer. *Good job!*
