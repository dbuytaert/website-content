Several people have commented on social media that last week's [TAG Heuer post](https://dri.es/tag-heuer-using-drupal) was a subtle (or not so subtle) gift request. In all honesty, it wasn't. That changes this week as I just learned that Lamborghini relaunched its website using Drupal 8. If anyone wants to gift a Lamborghini, don't hesitate to. Joking aside, it's great to see another famous brand use Drupal 8, including Drupal 8's new multi-lingual features. Check it out at <https://www.lamborghini.com>!
