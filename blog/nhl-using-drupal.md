# NHL using Drupal

Canada's [National Hockey League](https://www.nhl.com/) (NHL) is probably the highest level of professional ice hockey in world. With league revenue totaling 2.5 billion US dollars last year, the NHL is also big business. Joshua Schroeder, a Canadian Drupal developer, reported that the NHL has begun using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for several interactive sites that allow fans to participate in the annual all-star game voting, and weekly fan favorite awards. Example NHL sites built with Drupal include:

- [Fan all-star voting](http://fanballoting.nhl.com)
- [Fan favorite award](http://fanfav.nhl.com)
- [Greatest captain sweepstakes](http://bridgestone.nhl.com)

All these sites seem to be built with Drupal 6. More proof that Drupal 6 is getting serious traction. *Good stuff!*
