# Varnish using Drupal

We all know that [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) can work with [Varnish](http://varnish-cache.org/), a HTTP accelerator that caches pages in virtual memory. Well, now [Varnish](https://www.varnish-software.com/) uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) too! [Varnish Software](https://www.varnish-software.com/), the company behind Varnish, just relaunched its site using [Pressflow](http://pressflow.org), a Drupal distribution with performance and scalability improvements. The site was built by [Kodamera](http://www.kodamera.se).
