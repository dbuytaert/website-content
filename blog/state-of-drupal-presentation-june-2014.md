I gave my traditional State of Drupal presentation this week at DrupalCon Austin. You can [watch the recording of my keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnERPdAiuSo) if you are interested in learning about my vision for the future of the web, the challenges and opportunities ahead of us, how Drupal fits into that. In good tradition, you can also [download a copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-june-2014.pdf) (PDF, 120 MB).
