# Final 2009 wrapup

Over the last couple of days, I've written about how [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) and [Mollom](https://mollom.com) performed in 2009, respectively:

1. [Drupal 2009 retrospective and 2010 predictions](https://dri.es/drupal-2009-retrospective-and-2010-predictions)
2. [Acquia 2009 retrospective](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2009)
3. [Mollom 2009 retrospective](https://dri.es/mollom-2009-retrospective)

I don't write these posts to pass time. I write them for you and me. I write them for you, because you might benefit from my experiences. I write them for myself so I won't forget the details when I tell my grandchildren about you, and the crazy ride that was Drupal. That is why for me, technologies like Twitter and Facebook, won't replace blogging – they complement blogging. I predict that I'll continue to blog in 2010, whether you like it or not.

All in all, I've never worked harder than in 2009. 14 hour work days were standard, and I traveled almost 100,000 miles (160,000 km).

It paid off because 2009 was a year of growth. Drupal grew, Acquia grew, Mollom grew. The Drupal Association matured, and with [the birth of Stan](https://dri.es/stan-buytaert), my family grew. I met a lot new people, and learned many new things about both technology and business. There was a lot of personal growth in 2009. I pushed my boundaries and those of many of my peers.

Unfortunately, 2009 saw some regressions also. I virtually stopped doing any sports and I've been taking fewer pictures. To some extent, I inadequately addressed the growth of our family – Stan is still sleeping in our bedroom because we don't have a spare room in our apartment, and our 8 year old car broke down on several occasions and is way too small for us as a family. Both need upgrading. And, with a growing network of people, it is hard to stay in touch with all your friends. Long story short, you can probably guess several of my 2010 resolutions.

But, on days like today, when looking back at the past year, I am reminded of how lucky I am. 2009 was been a great year, and I'd like to thank all of you who have been part of it. You're my dream team.
