It's no secret that I travel around the world, evangelizing Drupal to new audiences and connecting with local communities, as well as contributors, from all over the world. In 2011 alone, I traveled more than 400,000 km (250,000 miles) and talked to thousands of Drupal people. Every day, I answer questions that many in the larger community would benefit from knowing as well.

To help facilitate holding these discussions on more of an international scale, I'd like to experiment with doing monthly, informal chats. In terms of format, I'd like to choose a general topic of discussion, then hold an hour-long phone call that all could dial into (with IRC for back-channel discussions and questions) where I can give an update on major Drupal happenings and allow plenty of time for Q&amp;A from the community on the topic for the month. A moderator will help with voicing/unvoicing people during the Q&amp;A section, and the chats would be recorded and put up for download for those who couldn't make it.

If this idea sounds interesting to you, please [join me for the first Drupal Fireside Chat on Friday, December 16 at 10 am Eastern US time](https://acquiawebinars.webex.com/acquiawebinars/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=669114608) (registration recommended so click 'register'). The topic I'd like to focus on for the first session is the **Drupal Core Development Process**, including sub-topics like a general status update on what is happening with Drupal 8, what role Drupal 8 initiatives and initiative owners have in the development of Drupal 8, and what process changes have been put in place to help improve Drupal 8's development process over Drupal 7's.

Feel free to post additional questions/topic ideas here, and hope to see you on Friday!
