# My Drupal predictions for 2007

Last night, I started writing down my predictions for 2007, but I have so many predictions it is no longer funny. It turned out to be impossible to capture them in a single coherent blog post, so I'll continue to share [my predictions](https://dri.es/tag/predictions) throughout the new year as I've been doing for a while now.

That said, here is one Drupal prediction to start the new year with:

*There are many million websites out there. But by the end of 2007, if you take 1,000 random websites, at least 3 of them will run Drupal. Spam sites and pornographic websites must be excluded from any such experiment.*
