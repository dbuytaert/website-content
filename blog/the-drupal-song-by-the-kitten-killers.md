DrupalCamps are like parties! After [I got Drupal](https://dri.es/i-got-drupal-by-ian-rhett), now the [Kitten Killers](http://nodeone.se) at DrupalCamp Stockholm with a cover of [Jeff Robbins' famous Drupal song](https://dri.es/the-drupal-song). For more information, [watch the interview with the Kitten Killers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2pXcNu4GRo). *Pay attention to this Drupal phenomenon!*
