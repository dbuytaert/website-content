As is now a tradition, here is my annual Acquia retrospective. Time to look back at 2013. In your life, you only get an opportunity to do so many things, so you have to focus on doing things that matter. I'm fortunate that [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com) are remarkable stories. I take time to write these retrospectives for you and for me. I write them for you, because you might benefit from my experiences or from analyzing the information provided. But I also write them for myself so I don't forget this incredible journey. If you want, you can read previous retrospectives: [2009](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2009), [2010](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2010), [2011](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2011) and [2012](https://dri.es/acquia-retrospective-2012).

For Acquia, 2013 was another excellent year. It was our fifth full year in business (i.e. revenue-generating year), and we finished the year with 19 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. In short, 2013 was a year of continued momentum, record bookings and great customer success. With five-year sales growth of more than 84,100 percent, Acquia was identified as the second fastest-growing company on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 in North America. Acquia was also listed among North America's fastest growing software companies in 2013's Inc. 500. We're all very proud of that.

We hired 208 people this year and ended the year with 412 employees, up from 280 employees at the end of last year. 337 employees are based in the US, with 197 in Burlington, 27 in Portland, and 113 remote employees. We employ 75 people outside of the US, 53 of which are based in our office in Reading, UK. In 2013, we almost doubled our headcount in the Reading and Portland offices. Additionally, we hired 31 interns in 2013.

Acquia grew its customer base to more than 4,000 organizations. Some of the brands we've added as customers include Intel Corporation, Polycom, News Corp Australia, Timex, the National Association of Realtors, the X PRIZE Foundation, Columbia University, McGraw Hill Financial, Bart.gov and the Red Cross.

In 2013, Acquia continued to be focused on providing Drupal support to our customers. We reached the milestone of 100,000 support requests received and resolved during our company lifespan. In 2013 alone, we resolved almost 32,000 customer service requests, up 30 percent from 2012. We invested a lot in scaling our support team and on improving overall customer satisfaction and responsiveness. For example, we created a dedicated customer onboarding team. The result is that we spent more time with our customers to better understand their needs and help solve their Drupal questions. In 2014, we'll continue to keep customer success front and center. It's something we are very passionate about.

With regards to Acquia's software products, it was certainly our busiest year. Not only did we continue to invest heavily in Acquia Cloud and Acquia Network, we also launched some new products. [Acquia Commerce Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/solutions/commerce) was unveiled last quarter, providing a platform for creating content-rich, socially enabled shopping experiences. Acquia Cloud Site Factory was also released, providing a platform for launching and managing hundreds of websites. We unveiled [Drupal Commons 3.0](http://commons.acquia.com/), our Drupal-based community platform, that was [identified a Social Platform leader by Forrester Research](https://www.acquia.com/resources/whitepaper/acquia-named-leader-forrester-wave-web-content-management-systems-q1-2017). And we delivered the general availability release of the [Mollom Content Moderation Platform](https://www.mollom.com/moderation), a content moderation platform built for the enterprise.

The cloud continues to prove to be a great way for organizations to save money, manage websites more efficiently and bring them to market faster. And Drupal is no exception to this trend – in 2013, many organizations decided to standardize on Drupal in a big way, moving away from the variety of different systems – exactly [the vision we laid out in 2010](https://dri.es/acquia-product-strategy-and-vision).

And the proof is in the numbers: Acquia Cloud grew from 4,300 AWS instances at the end of 2012 to 7,300 AWS instances at the end of 2013. In aggregate, we're now serving more than 22 billion hits a month or 319 TB of bandwidth. I believe that makes Acquia the largest Drupal infrastructure provider in the world. Some of the Acquia Cloud achievements I'm most proud of include hosting the [Grammy Awards](https://www.grammy.com/) (462 million visits) and hosting [Red Nose Day](https://dri.es/drupal-and-red-nose-day) during their largest fundraising event ever (£75 million/$113 million raised in one night).

### Drupal community and Acquia

In 2013, we continued our long track record of giving back to the larger Drupal community.

- We sponsored 77 Drupal events in 2013, helping thousands of Drupal developers connect and collaborate together.
- Our product teams sponsored work on numerous important community modules, such as [Media](https://www.drupal.org/project/media), [Organic Groups](https://www.drupal.org/project/og), and more ...
- The authoring experience work for Drupal 8 that we started last year landed in core this year, including [WYSIWYG](https://www.drupal.org/node/1890502) and in-place editing. We also sponsored work on [redesigned content creation page](https://wunder.io/blog/better-content-creation-page-drupal-8) and [an improved blocks UI](http://www.winstondodger.com/posts/block-ui-overhaul) for Drupal 8.
- Also on Drupal 8, we sponsored work on the [Web Services](https://groups.drupal.org/wscci) and [Migrate in Core](https://groups.drupal.org/imp) initiatives, donating the Migrate module authors' time.
- We helped set up numerous process improvements to help streamline Drupal 8 core development, including various ["hard problems"](https://groups.drupal.org/node/324278) discussions at DrupalCons to work through complex issues, releasing [monthly alpha releases](https://groups.drupal.org/node/364138) for user and developer feedback, and [laying out the criteria for beta 1](https://dri.es/the-next-step-for-drupal-8-is-a-beta). We've also helped establish communication channels to help promote what is happening in Drupal 8: the [This Week In Core](https://groups.drupal.org/taxonomy/term/98113) series, and the [Drupal 8.0 landing page](https://www.drupal.org/8).
- We helped the Drupal Association to establish [Drupal.org Working Groups](https://www.drupal.org/governance/drupalorg-working-groups) to provide better leadership and transparency to the Drupal website. Some of our team also helped assist on Drupal.org upgrade and security issues.

I'm particularly proud of Acquia's contributions to Drupal. It's part of our philosophy to give back, and we work hard to do our part by contributing to the Drupal community – the reason why we exist. I'm proud of this because it is not trivial to give back as much as we do.

### Conclusion

What I'm most proud of is that we have accomplished all of this "the open source way". Since Acquia's interests are so aligned with Drupal's, we try to raise the tide for the Drupal community at large.

At the end of the day, we're not selling Drupal or cloud hosting. We're selling what can be done with Drupal. The belief in the limitless. No matter what you dream, you can do it, and Drupal will get you there – and Acquia is here to help you succeed. Thank you for 2013, and we're looking forward to working with more customers that are changing the world.
