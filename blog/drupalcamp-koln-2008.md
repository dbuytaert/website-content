# DrupalCamp Köln

On January 17-18, I'll be in Germany to attend DrupalCamp Köln (aka *DrupalCamp Cologne*) and hang out with the German Drupal community. DrupalCamp Köln is organized by Thomas Narres, Daniel Niehaus, Jürgen Brocke, Torsten Zenk, Florian Latzel, and others in the Köln/Bonn users group.

This is the first ever Drupal-specific camp (or Drupal un-conference) that Germany has ever seen, and so far a little more than 150 people have signed up. The organizers are expecting to max out the venue with around 180 participants. Prominent German Drupalistas attending and/or presenting include: Konstantin Käfer, Hagen Graf, Daniel Juling, Ben Birkenhagen, Gerhard Killesreiter, and plenty of other great contributors. International Drupalistas coming include: Morten (King of Denmark), Mikkel Høgh (Denmark), Florian Loretan (USA / Switzerland), Roel Demeester (Belgium), Jo Wouters (Belgium), Damien Tournoud (France), Joeri Poesen (Belgium), and many more.

Three people from Acquia will be present; Robert Douglass, Jeffrey McGuire (aka Jam) and myself. I'll do a keynote on Drupal. Robert plans to demonstrate the latest Apache Solr improvements and will give a first glance at [Acquia's hosted search solution](https://dri.es/a-hosted-search-service-for-drupal). Robert and I will also be holding an Acquia Q&amp;A session, and Jam will be ready to help with your Drupal 5 to Drupal 6 upgrade problems, and pesky Views 1 to Views 2 conversions.
