# Christina Aguilera using Drupal

[Christina Aguilera](http://www.christinaaguilera.com/) just relaunched her website using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org): <http://www.christinaaguilera.com/>. The site is developed by [Sony Music](http://sonymusic.com), and is one of the better looking Drupal sites that I have seen Sony Music launch. No pun intended! *Welcome to the family, Christina!*
