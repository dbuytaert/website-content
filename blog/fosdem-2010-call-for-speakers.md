Like the years before, [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) was granted a *developer room* at [FOSDEM](http://www.fosdem.org), the Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting. FOSDEM is a yearly event for the open source community that attracts more than 3,000 developers from all around the world. It's good fun.

At the Drupal developer room you can meet fellow Drupal developers, listen to great talks and discuss Drupal. We'll have the Drupal developer room on Sunday, February 7th form 09:00h until 17:00h. The organizers are still looking for Drupal speakers; let us know in the [FOSDEM 2010 group on drupal.org](https://groups.drupal.org/fosdem) if you want to give a presentation.

Hope to see you at FOSDEM 2010!
