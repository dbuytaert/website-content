# MIT using Drupal

It would be interesting to get a list of all the Drupal sites at [MIT](http://web.mit.edu/) – I know they have quite a few. Recently, MIT's well-known Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) launched its new and improved website using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) at <http://www.csail.mit.edu>. [DIG](http://dig.csail.mit.edu), a group at CSAIL that includes father of the web [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee), has been using Drupal for many years now. *Great!*
