Did you know there is a DrupalCamp that is bigger than most past DrupalCons? It's the Bay Area Drupal Camp, or [BADCamp](http://badcamp.net) which is expected to draw over 1,400 people this year for three days of trainings, summits, sprints, sessions, BOFs and parties all across Berkeley this weekend.

Instead of giving a morning keynote, I will be interviewed by [Josh Koenig](https://www.drupal.org/user/3313) after we've been both [been drinking for a while](http://2011.badcamp.net/program/sessions/evening-drupal-dine-drink-and-drupal). I'm very excited about the interview format and having it in the evening. The traditional keynote presentation format works well for making statements, but DrupalCamps inspire often a different mood. I expect the interview format will fit this *ambiance* by being more probing and personal than a straightforward keynote could be.

We still haven't decided on the questions... and that is where you come in. If you were in Josh's positions, what would you ask me? What topics should we discuss together? Just suggest your questions in the comments of this post. Josh will pick both the most popular and the most interesting ones and see where they go.

I look forward to seeing many of you at BADCamp next week!
