# Pro Drupal Development book for Drupal 5

[John VanDyk](https://www.sysarchitects.com/blog) and [Matt Westgate](http://www.asitis.org/) have written a Drupal book for developers: [Pro Drupal Development](http://drupalbook.com/), published by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/).

Last week, [I finally got a copy of the book in the mail](https://dri.es/drupal-pro-book-cracks-amazon-top-100#comment-1555) and now I've read it, I can say that it is exactly what we expected it to be: awesome.

So, John and Matt – for the love of God – make sure there will be a Drupal 6 version of that book.

More information, including a free chapter on how to theme Drupal, can be found at [http://drupalbook.com](http://drupalbook.com/).
