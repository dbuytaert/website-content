[Hagen Graf](http://www.cocoate.com), author of a [German Drupal book](https://dri.es/german-addison-wesley-drupal-book), recently donated 700 EUR to the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org). This money comes from a [German Drupal 5 training video](https://dri.es/drupal-5-training-video) that he made together with [Video2brain](https://www.video2brain.com/). For every copy they sold, 1.25 EUR was set aside for the Drupal Association, and over the course of six months, this added up to a 700 EUR donation.

If you do the math, it is easy enough to figure out that they sold 600 copies in 6 months. So not only did they contribute 700 EUR to the Drupal Assocation, they also helped 600 Germans to get started with Drupal. *A double hit!*

Assuming that the above is correct and given that the DVD sells for 39,95 EUR a copy, it means that this German training video generated roughly 24,000 EUR in revenue. I don't know how much of that is left after they extract all the expenses, discounts and donations, but it does make me wonder about the potential of a Drupal training video recorded in English ...
