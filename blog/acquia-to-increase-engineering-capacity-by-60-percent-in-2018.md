I'm excited to share that [Acquia plans to increase the capacity of our global research and development team](https://www.acquia.com/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/acquia-doubles-personalization-business-2017-grows-customer-base) by 60 percent in 2018. Last year, we saw adoption of Acquia Lift more than double, and adoption of Acquia Cloud Site Factory nearly double. Increasing our investment in engineering will allow us to support this growth, in addition to accelerating our innovation. Acquia's product teams have an exciting year ahead!
