After the [Emmys](https://dri.es/emmys-using-drupal), the Grammys are onto it as well. That is, the new [Grammy.com](http://www.grammy.com) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) – and [Pressflow](https://launchpad.net/pressflow) to be specific. The Grammy Awards, or Grammys, are presented annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences for outstanding achievements in the music industry. *Cool!*
