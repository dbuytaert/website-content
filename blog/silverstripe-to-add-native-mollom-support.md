# SilverStripe to add native Mollom support

[SilverStripe](https://www.silverstripe.org/) has announced that the [upcoming release](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/silverstripe-2-3-1rc1-released-testers-wanted/) of their open-source CMS includes native support for [Mollom](https://mollom.com). According to the [announcement](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/silverstripe-2-3-1rc1-released-testers-wanted/), SilverStripe's Mollom implementation protects page and blog comments, user registrations, forum posts, and custom PHP forms.

The SilverStripe [Mollom installation instructions](https://docs.silverstripe.org/doku.php?id=modules:mollom#installation) provide additional information on how to install and use Mollom with your installation of the release candidate. The [installation instructions](https://docs.silverstripe.org/doku.php?id=modules:mollom#installation) also show some screenshots of Mollom in action.

If you're a SilverStripe user, take the [release candidate](https://www.silverstripe.org/blog/silverstripe-2-3-1rc1-released-testers-wanted//) for a test drive and file any bugs you encounter at [open.silverstripe.com](http://open.silverstripe.com).
