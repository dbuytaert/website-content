# Hagen's Drupal book in the mail

Hagen Graf has written a German Drupal book: [Drupal: Community-Websites entwickeln und verwalten mit dem Open Source-CMS](https://www.amazon.de/exec/obidos/ASIN/3827323215/) published by [Addison-Wesley](https://bookshop.pearson.de/3827323215.html). I got a copy of the book in the mail today and took some pictures. *Thanks Hagen, Boris and Uwe!*
