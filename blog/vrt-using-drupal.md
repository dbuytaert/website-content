The [Flemish Radio- and Television Network](http://vrt.be) (VRT) uses [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) for [16+](http://16plus.be/), a community website to accompany one of the television programs they broadcast. The website allows people to upload and share pictures, music and video. Belgian newspaper [De Standaard](http://www.standaard.be/) described [16+](http://16plus.be/) as the "Flemish YouTube". Belgian newspaper [De Morgen](https://www.demorgen.be/) refers to it as being an "online community".

Development of the website was coordinated by the [Interdisciplinary institute for BroadBand Technology](https://www.iminds.be/en) (IBBT), a research institute founded by the Flemish government. Next week I'll meet some of the people behind 16+ and IBBT as I committed to giving them a short Drupal presentation.
