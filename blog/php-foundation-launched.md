# PHP Foundation launched

There is a common misconception that large open source projects are well-funded. In practice, many rely on a small group of maintainers.

The [PHP](https://www.php.net/) programming language is one of them. Despite being used by [75%+ of the web](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language), PHP only has a few full-time contributors.

That is why the [PHP Foundation](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/) is launching. Its mission: <q>The PHP Foundation will be a non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure the long life and prosperity of the PHP language.</q>.

[Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) is proud to support the PHP Foundation by contributing $25,000 to the foundation, alongside [Automattic](https://automattic.com/), [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and others. Our donations will help fund the development of PHP.

PHP is vital to the functioning of governments, schools, non-profits, private companies, public companies, and much more. If your organization relies on PHP, I'd encourage you to [make a contribution](https://opencollective.com/phpfoundation).

Large open source projects like PHP need meaningful, long-term support. I remain very passionate about [how to make Open Source production more sustainable](https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source), more fair, more egalitarian, and more cooperative. It will be interesting to see how the [PHP Foundation](https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2021/11/the-php-foundation/) develops.
