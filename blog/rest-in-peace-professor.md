Stephen Hawking passed away this morning at age 76. He was an inspiration in so many ways: his contributions to science unlocked a universe of exploration and he helped to dismantle stigma surrounding disability. Perhaps most importantly, he dedicated his life to meaningful work that he was deeply passionate about; a message that is important for all. Rest in peace, Professor.
