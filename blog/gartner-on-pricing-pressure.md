In a [research note](http://software.silicon.com/applications/0,39024653,39169187,00.htm), Gartner predicted what most people already knew: proprietary software is going to face serious pricing pressure from a range of different software trends.

Specifically, [Gartner](http://www.gartner.com/) identified seven trends putting pricing pressure on software business models:

> These include business process outsourcing; software as a service (SaaS); low-cost development environments, such as China and India, combined with modular architectures and service-oriented architectures; the emergence of third-party software maintenance and support; growing interest in open source; the rise of Chinese software companies; and the expansion of the Brazilian, Chinese and Indian markets.

Anyway, it looks like [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) is in good shape: it is open source software with a modular architecture that lends itself to delivering web services. Also, [Drupal 6 is all about reaching out to more people](https://dri.es/reaching-out-with-drupal-6); I'm confident that Drupal 6's localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) improvements will help us get more traction in Brazil, China and India.
