# Mollom at TechCrunch Belgium Meeting

A couple of weeks ago we pitched [Mollom](https://mollom.com) at the TechCrunch Belgium Meeting organized by [Robin Wauters](http://www.edentity.be/), our Belgian [Michael Arrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Arrington) (i.e. Robin writes for [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com) and is the organizer of [the Plugg conference](http://plugg.eu/)).

[Mike Butcher](http://mbites.com/) of [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com) was invited to cover the event as part of his [TechCrunch Euro Tour](https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/14/techcrunch-events-across-europe/). He just posted [his round-up of the event](https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/21/techcrunch-euro-tour-08-yes-even-belgium-has-startups/), titled ["Yes, even Belgium has startups"](https://techcrunch.com/2008/11/21/techcrunch-euro-tour-08-yes-even-belgium-has-startups/), and concluded his Mollom summary with the words: "I think this has long legs.". *Thanks Mike!*
