Ric Johnson of [OpenDomain](https://opendomain.org/) bought the drupal.com domain from a cyber-squatter and donated it to me. For more information, [read the press release at Yahoo! Finance](https://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060929/phf010.html). *Thanks for the generosity, Ric!*

Taken from the press release:

"OpenDomain's generous donation will enable us to extend Drupal's presence and facilitate continued growth of the Drupal project. We are very grateful for this contribution.
