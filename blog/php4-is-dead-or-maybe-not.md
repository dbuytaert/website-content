# PHP4 is dead ... or maybe not

It is 08/08/08 today. The day they took PHP4 behind the barn and shot it through the head. The date of the official discontinuation of PHP4 – even for security issues.

Unfortunately, as [I predicted in April 2007](https://dri.es/php-is-dead-long-live-php), PHP4 is still more widely used than PHP5 is. According to [the latest Nexen data](http://www.nexen.net/chiffres_cles/phpversion/18608-evolution_de_php_sur_internet_juillet_2008.php), PHP5 has only a 33% install base after more than four years.

Drupal's success depends on that of PHP, and PHP5's slow adoption rate has certainly been annoying. Hopefully, we can all move forward together now. Drupal is ready for it.

If you still haven't upgraded to PHP5, today would be a good day.
