# Mollom volume segmentation

When people sign up to protect their website against spam with [Mollom](https://mollom.com), they are asked to categorize each of their sites. So far, almost 2,000 Drupal sites have been categorized. The available categories are: a company website (22%), a site built for a customer (7%), a non-profit website (27%) or a personal website (44%).

It is only one data point and a relatively small sample so I don't know if it is safe to generalize, but I figured it was an interesting nugget that could help us understand Drupal's install base.
