This Saturday and Sunday, March 9-10, over 30 locations around the world will participate in [Global Drupal Sprint Weekend](https://groups.drupal.org/node/277768), coordinated by [Cathy Theys](http://comm-press.de/en/users/cathy-theys) [(YesCT)](https://www.drupal.org/user/258568). The sprint weekend is a grassroots initiative for people all over the world to get together and contribute to Drupal. You can join a local sprint, start your own, or participate remotely in [IRC](https://www.drupal.org/irc).

The sprint weekend is a unique opportunity to make big strides on the Drupal 8 release, and I encourage everyone to find something you are passionate about and dive in. For example, you can help reduce Drupal 8's accumulated technical debt by targeting the major and critical [threshold issues](https://dri.es/code-freeze-and-thresholds), to kick off our cleanup phase and make Drupal 8 stable enough that we can continue to innovate. We're currently at 18 critical bugs, 124 major bugs, 33 critical tasks, and 130 major tasks. It'd be great to see how many of these we can fix by this time next week! :-)

Or, try your hand at upgrading a module to Drupal 8, and provide input and feedback on the "Developer Experience", as well as identify missing or incomplete APIs while we can still change them. You can find resources to help you with porting modules on [the sprint wiki page](https://groups.drupal.org/node/277768).

Whatever you work on, blog or tweet about it after the sprint is done. Let us know what you worked on. You can also share what worked well for your sprint, or things you learned. Tag your posts with [\#SprintWeekend](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SprintWeekend&src=hash) so we can use your feedback to help shape future sprints!

Finally, if you're local to the Boston area, Acquia is also hosting an [Open Drupal 8 Core sprint](https://www.acquia.com/resources/events/open-drupal-8-core-sprint-part-drupal-sprint-weekend) in our Burlington office that will target core threshold issues, including work on the Blocks UI. Lots of active contributors to Drupal 8 will be here to help you find something awesome to work on. Stop by!
