# CBC using Drupal

The [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation) (CBC) is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for one of their cross-media shows: [Exposure](http://exposure.cbc.ca/).

The site lets people share their short movies with a national television audience and online community. Each week, the community helps determine the videos they think should get on TV. (Hat tip: [Khalid](https://2bits.com/))
