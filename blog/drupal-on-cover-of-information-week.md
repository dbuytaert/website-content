Drupal was featured on the cover of last week's [Information Week](http://www.informationweek.com/), a weekly technology magazine with 440,000 subscribers. The accompanying article is also available online: [Collaboration is at the heart of Open Source content management](http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/open_source/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212002359).
