The past months have been absolutely crazy in terms of Drupal work. And there is still so much Drupal work left to do, it isn't even funny. Yet, with my marriage around the corner (and our honeymoon directly after that), it is time for me to disconnect and to avoid working on Drupal after hours. Time to unwind. I'll pick up my Drupal work and responsibilities in about one month. Please take good care of [my baby](https://www.drupal.org/) during my absence.

In the mean time, chances are that I continue posting to my blog to report back from the joyous adventures of what is marriage.

Reset.
