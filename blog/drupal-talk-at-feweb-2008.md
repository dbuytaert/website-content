# Drupal talk at FeWeb

I gave a Drupal presentation at the annual FeWeb conference here in Belgium last night. [FeWeb](http://www.feweb.be) is a Belgian association for website developers; this year was the sixth edition of their annual conference.

I was shocked, surprised and pleased to find that everyone in the audience had heard of Drupal and almost half of the audience had actively used it. I had lengthy conversations with a number of Belgian Drupal shops, including [Coworks](http://coworks.be) and [Connexion](http://connexion.be), and discovered that almost all of them have made [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) their main platform during the last year. Most reported that they can't keep up with the Drupal demand.

Clearly, Drupal has grown massively in Belgium over the last year ...
