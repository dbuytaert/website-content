In my [DrupalCon Amsterdam keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-october-2019) last October, I shared my thoughts on what I believe is important for the future of [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/).

Today it is your turn.

After every major release of Drupal, we distribute a survey to get the community's feedback on what to focus on for future releases of Drupal.

The last time we conducted such a survey was four years ago, after the [release of Drupal 8](https://dri.es/drupal-8-released). The results were the basis for [defining Drupal 8 product initiatives](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2016), organized on the [Drupal 8 mountain](https://dri.es/drupal-long-term-growth-obstacles) that I've been using for the past few years.

In a similar way, this new survey will help lay the groundwork for the strategic direction of the Drupal project over the next 3–5 years.

We'd like to hear from everyone who cares about Drupal: content managers, site owners, site builders, module developers, front-end developers, people selling Drupal, and anyone else who touches the Drupal project in any capacity. Whether you are a Drupal expert or just getting started with Drupal, every voice counts!

**Update:** The survey is closed and the link to the survey has been removed from this post. I presented the [2020 product survey results in my DrupalCon Global keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-july-2020). If you'd like to do your own analysis of the survey data, you can [download a copy of the raw survey results](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-survey-2020-raw.xlsx) (Microsoft Excel format) and look at the raw data yourself. I anonymized the data by removing the names, e-mail addresses and IP address information.

*To create the survey, I worked with [Brian Prue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-prue-a36822186/), [Gábor Hojtsy](https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy), [Angela Byron](https://www.drupal.org/u/webchick) and [Matthew Grasmick](https://www.drupal.org/u/grasmash). Initial versions were improved based on test runs with over a dozen people in the Drupal community. Thank you for all their feedback along the way.*
