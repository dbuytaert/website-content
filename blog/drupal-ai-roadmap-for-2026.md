# Drupal's AI roadmap for 2026

[image drupal/drupal-ai-roadmap-2026 priority=true]

For the past months, the AI Initiative Leadership Team has been working with [our contributing partners](https://www.drupal.org/ai/makers) to define what the Drupal AI initiative should focus on in 2026. That plan is now ready, and I want to share it with the community.

This roadmap builds directly on the strategy we outlined in [Accelerating AI Innovation in Drupal](https://dri.es/accelerating-ai-innovation-in-drupal). That post described the direction. This plan turns it into concrete priorities and execution for 2026.

The full plan is [available as a PDF](https://dri.es/files/drupal-ai-roadmap-2026.pdf), but let me explain the thinking behind it.

Producing consistently high-quality content and pages is really hard. Excellent content requires a subject matter expert who actually knows the topic, a copywriter who can translate expertise into clear language, someone who understands your audience and brand, someone who knows how to structure pages with your component library, good media assets, and an SEO/AEO specialist so people actually discover what you made. 

Most organizations are missing at least some of these skillsets, and even when all the people exist, coordinating them is where everything breaks down. We believe AI can fill these gaps, not by replacing these roles but by making their expertise available to every content creator on the team.

For large organizations, this means stronger brand consistency, better accessibility, and improved compliance across thousands of pages. For smaller ones, it means access to skills that were previously out of reach: professional copywriting, SEO, and brand-consistent design without needing a specialist for each.

Used carelessly, AI just makes these problems worse by producing fast, generic content that sounds like everything else on the internet. But used well, with real structure and governance behind it, AI can help organizations raise the bar on quality rather than just volume.

[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) has always been built around the realities of serious content work: structured content, workflows, permissions, revisions, moderation, and more. These capabilities are what make quality possible at scale. They're also exactly [the foundation AI needs](https://dri.es/why-drupal-is-built-for-the-ai-era) to actually work well.

Rather than bolting on a chatbot or a generic text generator, we're embedding AI into the content and page creation process itself, guided by the structure, governance, and brand rules that already live in Drupal.

For website owners, the value is faster site building, faster content delivery, smarter user journeys, higher conversions, and consistent brand quality at scale. For digital agencies, it means delivering higher-quality websites in less time. And for IT teams, it means less risk and less overhead: automated compliance, auditable changes, and fewer ad hoc requests to fix what someone published.

We think the real opportunity goes further than just adding AI to what we already have. It's also about connecting how content gets created, how it performs, and how it gets governed into one loop, so that what you learn from your content actually shapes what you build next.

The things that have always made Drupal good at content are the same things that make AI trustworthy. That is not a coincidence, and it's why we believe Drupal is the right place to build this.

### What we're building in 2026

The 2026 plan identifies eight capabilities we'll focus on. Each is described in detail in the [full plan](https://dri.es/files/drupal-ai-roadmap-2026.pdf), but here is a quick overview:

* **Page generation** - Describe what you need and get a usable page, built from your actual design system components
* **Context management** - A central place to define brand voice, style guides, audience profiles, and governance rules that AI can use
* **Background agents** - AI that works without being prompted, responding to triggers and schedules while respecting editorial workflows
* **Design system integration** - AI that builds with your components and can propose new ones when needed
* **Content creation and discovery** - Smarter search, AI-powered optimization, and content drafting assistance
* **Advanced governance** - Batch approvals, branch-based versioning, and comprehensive audit trails for AI changes
* **Intelligent website improvements** - AI that learns from performance data, proposes concrete changes, and gets smarter over time through editorial review
* **Multi-channel campaigns** - Create content for websites, social, email, and automation platforms from a single campaign goal

These eight capabilities are where the official AI Initiative is focusing its energy, but they're not the whole picture for AI in Drupal. There is a lot more we want to build that didn't make this initial list, and we expect to revisit the plan in six months to a year.

We also want to be clear: community contributions outside this scope are welcome and important. Work on migrations, chatbots, and other AI capabilities continues in the broader Drupal community. If you're building something that isn't in our 2026 plan, keep going.

### How we're making this happen

Over the past year, we've brought together organizations willing to contribute people and funding to the AI initiative.  Today, [28 organizations support the initiative](https://drupal.org/ai/makers), collectively pledging more than 23 full-time equivalent contributors. That is over 50 individual contributors working across time zones and disciplines.

Coordinating 50+ people across organizations takes real structure, so we've hired two dedicated teams from among our partners:

* [QED42](https://www.qed42.com/) is focused on innovation, pushing forward on what is next. 
* [1xINTERNET](https://www.1xinternet.com/) is focused on productization, taking what we've built and making it stable, intuitive, and easy to install.

Both teams are [creating backlogs](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search?issue_tags=AI%20Initiative%20Sprint), managing issues, and giving all our contributors clear direction. You can read more about [how we are going from strategy to execution](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot/initiatives/ai/blog/from-strategy-to-execution-how-the-drupal-ai-initiative-is-scaling-delivery-for-2026).

This is a new model for Drupal. We're testing whether open source can move faster when you pool resources and coordinate in a new way.

### Get involved

If you're a contributing partner, we're asking you to align your contributions with this plan. The [prioritized backlogs](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/ai_initiative?categories=All) are in place, so pick up something that fits and let's build.

If you're not a partner but want to contribute, jump in. The prioritized backlogs are open to everyone.

And if you want to [join the initiative as an official partner](https://new.drupal.org/ai/become-a-maker), we'd absolutely welcome that.

This plan wasn't built in a room by itself. It's the result of collaboration across 28 sponsoring organizations who bring expertise in UX, core development, QA, marketing, and more. Thank you.

We're building something new for Drupal,  in a new way, and I'm excited to see where it goes.
