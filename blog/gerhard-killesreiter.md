# Gerhard Killesreiter

At the same time [I invited Neil Drumm](/neil-drumm) to help [Steven](http://acko.net/) and myself out with the next Drupal version, I asked Gerhard Killesreiter to help with the day to day maintenance of the current Drupal version, Drupal 4.7. Having a dedicated maintainer who's task is to secure the stability of the Drupal 4.7 release series is going to be extremely valuable. I choose Gerhard because he has the kind of unspoken commitment that a father shows to his child. That and he is particularly skilled in saying <q>no, only bugfixes are allowed</q>, and <q>what part of 'no' don't you understand?</q> in particular. So far, it's been one of my best decisions in months.
