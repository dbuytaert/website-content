I first met Jeremy Andrews through [KernelTrap](http://kerneltrap.com), a website that reports about everything that's happening in the Linux kernel world. It has been one of my favorite web sites. Back in 2001, KernelTrap ran on [PostNuke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postnuke), but I managed to convince Jeremy to switch to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). He learned so much about Drupal in the process, the he quit his day job and started his own Drupal business, [Tag1 Consulting](http://tag1consulting.com).

Now Jeremy is launching [Drupal Watchdog](http://drupalwatchdog.com), the first print magazine dedicated to Drupal. I admired Jeremy's reporting when I was a regular reader of KernelTrap so I'm excited to see how Drupal Watchdog will take shape. Despite the irony of dedicating a print magazine to a web technology, it has the potential to become quite a highlight in the history of Drupal, and an important new tool in how we share information and communicate. To that extend, I've decide to write a column for Drupal Watchdog.

The first issue will be distributed exclusively at [DrupalCon Chicago](http://chicago2011.drupal.org) in March as part of the attendee bag. It's yet another reason to attend DrupalCon Chicago. For more information, check <http://drupalwatchdog.com> or get in touch with Jeremy at <jeremy@tag1consulting.com>.
