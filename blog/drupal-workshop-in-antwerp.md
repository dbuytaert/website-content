Two pictures taken at the [free Drupal workshop in Antwerp](https://dri.es/my-first-drupal-workshops). Hopefully some of the students will start contributing to Drupal once they [started kicking ass](https://dri.es/drupal-learning-curve).

As one of the teachers, I had good fun and actually learned a lot about teaching Drupal. It gave me fresh perspectives on how we can continue to improve the Drupal experience. *We have work to do!*
