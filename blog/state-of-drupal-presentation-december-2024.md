At DrupalCon Asia in Singapore a few weeks ago, I delivered my traditional [State of Drupal keynote](https://dri.es/tag/state-of-drupal). This event marked DrupalCon's return to Asia after an eight-year hiatus, with the last one being [DrupalCon Mumbai in 2016](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-february-2016).

It was so fun to reconnect with the Drupal community across Asia and feel the passion and enthusiasm for [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/). The positive energy was so contagious that three weeks later, I still feel inspired by it.

If you missed the keynote, you can [watch the video](https://youtu.be/dnfQ8G-haXs) below, or [download my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-december-2024.pdf) (196 MB).

I talked about the significant progress we've made on Drupal CMS (code name [Drupal Starshot](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-starshot)) since [DrupalCon Barcelona](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2024) just a few months ago.

Our vision for Drupal CMS is clear: to set the standard for no-code website building. My updates highlighted how Drupal CMS empowers digital marketers and content creators to design sophisticated digital experiences while preserving Drupal's power and flexibility.

For more background on Drupal CMS, I recommend reading our [three-year strategy document](https://dri.es/introducing-drupal-starshot-product-strategy). We're about a quarter of the way through, time-wise, and as you'll see from my keynote, we're making very fast progress.

Below are some of the key improvements I showcased in my keynote, highlighted in short video segments. These videos demonstrate just 7 recipes, but we have nearly 20 in development.

Watching these demos, it will become very clear how much time and effort Drupal CMS can save for both beginners and experienced developers. Manually assembling these features would take weeks for a Drupal expert and months for a novice. These recipes pack a wealth of expertise and best practices. What once took a Drupal expert weeks can now be done by a novice in hours.

### AI support in Drupal

We're integrating AI agents into Drupal to assist with complex site-building tasks, going far beyond just content creation. Users can choose to have AI complete tasks automatically or provide step-by-step guidance, helping them learn Drupal as they go.

### Search

We're including enhanced search functionality that includes autocomplete and faceted search, delivering enterprise-grade functionality out-of-the-box.

### Privacy

With increasing global privacy regulations, marketers need robust compliance solutions, yet very few content management systems offer this out-of-the-box. I demonstrated how Drupal CMS will offer a user-centric approach to privacy and consent management, making compliance easier and more effective.

### Media management

Our improved media management tools now include features like focal point control and image style presets, enabling editors to handle visual content efficiently while maintaining accessibility standards.

### Accessibility tools

Our accessibility tools provide real-time feedback during content creation, helping identify and resolve potential issues that could affect the user experience for visually-impaired visitors.

### Analytics

Analytics integration streamlines the setup of Google Analytics and Tag Manager, something that 75% of all marketers use.

### Experience Builder

Drupal's new Experience Builder will bring a massive improvement in visual page building. It combines drag-and-drop simplicity with an enterprise-grade component architecture. It looks fantastic, and I'm really excited for it!

### Conclusion

In addition to our progress on Drupal CMS, the product, we've made real strides in other areas, such as marketing, modernizing Drupal.org, and improving documentation. These are all important parts of the [Drupal Starshot](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-starshot) initiative.

Overall, I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made. So much so that we've released [our first release candidate](https://new.drupal.org/drupal-cms/release-candidate) at DrupalCon Singapore, which you can try today by following [my installation instructions for Drupal CMS](https://dri.es/installing-drupal-cms-or-drupal-starshot-using-ddev).

While we still have a lot of work left, we are on track for the official release on January 15, 2025! To mark the occasion, we're inviting the Drupal community to organize release parties around the world. Whether you want to host your own event or join a party near you, you can find all the [details and sign-up links for Drupal CMS release parties](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/join-the-party-help-us-launch-drupal-cms-in-style). I'll be celebrating from Boston and hope to drop in on other parties via Zoom!

Finally, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has contributed to Drupal CMS and DrupalCon Singapore. Your hard work and dedication have made this possible. Thank you!
