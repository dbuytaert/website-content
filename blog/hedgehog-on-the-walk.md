# Hedgehog on the walk

[image miscellaneous-2006/hedgehog-on-the-walk]

I was in Italy last week to attend the [International Summer School on Advanced Computer Architecture and Compilation for Embedded Systems](https://www.hipeac.net/acaces2006/) when I bumped into this Italian hedgehog on my way to breakfast. (HiPEAC, the organization behind the summer school is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) for [their website](https://www.hipeac.net/).)
