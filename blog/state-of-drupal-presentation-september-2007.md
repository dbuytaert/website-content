[Robert Garrigos](https://garrigos.cat/) from the [Drupal Catalan user group](http://www.drupal.cat/) just uploaded a video of the State of Drupal presentation that I gave at DrupalCon Barcelona 3 months ago. The presentation shares the results of a [survey that I conducted in August](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-2007-survey); the survey ran for 30+ days, collected more than 1,000 responses, and should do a pretty good job capturing the *Drupal Zeitgeist*.

Download a [copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2007.pdf) (PDF, 14 MB).
