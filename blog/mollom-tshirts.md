# Mollom t-shirts

Ben and I printed some Mollom t-shirts and we're going to ship some to people that contributed a [Mollom plugin](https://www.mollom.com/download) or that took advantage of the Mollom API in new or clever ways.

We've just sent some t-shirts to [Mattias](https://www.netsensei.nl/) (Wordpress plugin), [Tijs](http://blog.verkoyen.eu/) (PHP5 class), [Markus](https://crosstec.org/) (Joomla extension), [Jan](http://workswithruby.com/) (Ruby library), [Andy](http://www.itkovian.net/) (Python library), [Wim](http://wimleers.com) (summer intern) and more. Let us know if you integrated Mollom in your favorite tool or service!

We also set aside some t-shirts for people that write the best Mollom reviews or otherwise help us spread the word in new, clever or interesting ways ...
