Although my blog has been quiet, a lot has happened with the [Drupal Starshot project](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot) since [its announcement](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2024) a month ago. We provided an update in the [first Drupal Starshot virtual meeting](https://youtu.be/ELApwaOoyDM), which is available as a recording.

Today, I am excited to introduce the newly formed Drupal Starshot leadership team.

### Meet the leadership team

#### Product Lead: Dries Buytaert

I will continue to lead the Drupal Starshot project, focusing on defining the product vision and strategy and building the leadership team. In the past few weeks, I have cleared other responsibilities to dedicate a significant amount of time to Drupal Starshot and Drupal Core.

#### Technical Lead: Tim Plunkett (Acquia)

[Tim](https://www.drupal.org/u/timplunkett) will oversee technical decisions and facilitate contributions from the community. His role includes building a team of Drupal Starshot Committers, coordinating with Drupal Core Committers, and ensuring that Drupal Starshot remains stable, secure, and easy to upgrade. With 7 years of engineering leadership experience, Tim will help drive technical excellence. Acquia is providing Tim the opportunity to work full-time on the Drupal Starshot project.

#### User Experience Lead: Cristina Chumillas (Lullabot)

[Cristina](https://www.drupal.org/u/ckrina) will define the design and user experience vision for Drupal Starshot. She will engage with contributors to initiate research activities and share the latest UI/UX best practices, ensuring a user-centric approach. She has been leading UX-related Drupal Core initiatives for over 7 years. Lullabot, Cristina's employer, has generously offered her the opportunity to work on Drupal Starshot full-time.

#### Product Owner: Pamela Barone (Technocrat)

[Pam](https://www.drupal.org/u/pameeela) will help ensure alignment and progress among contributors, including defining and prioritizing work. She brings strong communication and organizational skills, having led Drupal projects for more than 12 years.

#### Contribution Coordinator: Gábor Hojtsy (Acquia)

[Gábor](https://www.drupal.org/u/g%C3%A1bor-hojtsy) will focus on making it easier for individuals and organizations to contribute to Drupal Starshot. With extensive experience in Open Source contribution and community engagement, Gábor will help communicate progress, collaborate with the Drupal Association, and much more. Acquia will provide Gábor with the opportunity to work full-time on the Drupal Starshot project.

### Starshot Council (Advisory Board)

To support the leadership team, we are establishing the Starshot Council, an advisory board that will include:

1. Three end-users (site builders)
2. Three [Certified Drupal Partners](https://www.drupal.org/association/become-a-drupal-certified-partner)
3. Two Drupal Core Committers (one framework manager and one release manager)
4. Three [Drupal Association board members](https://www.drupal.org/association/board), one from each of the following [Board Working Groups](https://www.drupal.org/association/board/committees): Innovation, Marketing, and Fundraising
5. Two [staff members from the Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association/staff)

The council will meet monthly to ensure the leadership team remains aligned with the broader community and strategic goals. The [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association) is leading the effort to gather candidates, and the members of the Starshot Council will be announced in the coming weeks.

### More opportunities to get involved

There are many opportunities for others to get involved as committers, designers, developers, content creators, and more.

We have specific tasks that need to be completed, such as finishing Project Browser, Recipes and Automatic Updates. To help people get involved with this work, we have set up [several interactive Zoom calls](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot#sessions). We'll update you on our progress and give you practical advice on where and how you can contribute.

Beyond the tasks we know need to be completed, there are still many details to define. Our next step is to identify these. My first priority was to establish the leadership team. With that in place, we can focus on product definition and clarifying the unknowns. We'll brief you on our initial ideas and next steps in our [next Starshot session](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot#sessions) this Friday.

### Conclusion

The Drupal Starshot project is off to an exciting start with this exceptional leadership team. I am grateful to these talented individuals for stepping up to drive this important project. Their combined expertise and dedication will drive excitement and improvements for the Drupal platform, ultimately benefiting our entire community. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to make strides in this ambitious initiative.
