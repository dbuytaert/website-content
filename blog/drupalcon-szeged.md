# DrupalCon Szeged

Good news! The next Drupal conference (DrupalCon) will take place in [Szeged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szeged), [Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary) from August 27-30. If you want to learn more about [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), or if you want to capture and absorb the passion and enthusiasm behind the Drupal project, this is the place to be.

DrupalCon Szeged will bring together hundreds of Drupal users and developers from all around the world. Whether you are a Drupal professional or an enthusiastic user coming to find out more, you're invited to [join us in Szeged](http://szeged2008.drupalcon.org/). *Mark your calendars!*

This will be the first Drupal conference in [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe), and I'm excited by that. There are a lot of Drupal people in Central Europe, probably more so than in [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe), and this is a great way to reach out them. Plus, I've been to Hungary twice and liked it very much.
