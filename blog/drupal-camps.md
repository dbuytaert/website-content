Tomorrow is [DrupalCamp Paris](http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampParis) and 60 people signed up. Next week is [DrupalCamp New York](http://barcamp.org/DrupalCampNYC2) and 60 people signed up already. Two of my favorite cities in the world. *Insane!*

(Like a [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/), a DrupalCamp is an ad-hoc un-conference driven by its attendees. It is free and open for everyone but it has no visitors, only participants.)
