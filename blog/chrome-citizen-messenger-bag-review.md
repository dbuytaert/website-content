Like all the [hipster fixie kids](https://dri.es/my-drupal-bike) in the hilly San Francisco, I recently bought a [Citizen Messenger Bag](https://www.chromeindustries.com/) by [Chrome](http://www.chromebagsstore.com). I sport the black on black version. Over the last two months, as I've actively used it, I've come to conclude that this is quite possibly the best bag ever made.

Technically, the [Chrome Citizen Messenger Bag](https://www.chromeindustries.com/) is not a laptop case; it is designed by bike couriers for bike couriers. That said, I use it for my everyday activities, including business meetings, conferences, day trips, etc. It stows my laptop, my Kindle, my iPad, a notebook, a jacket, my camera, a water bottle and more. I definitely recommend this bag to anyone who likes to carry a few things around. In fact, this was the first bag big enough to hold all the schwag I got at DrupalCon – and that means something. But if all you need to store is a laptop and a few other items, it's still a great bag as it compresses down.

As someone who travels a lot, I need a bag that can handle a lot. The Chrome Citizen bag is built like a tank; it's made from weatherproof heavy-duty 1000-denier [Cordura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordura) with a weatherproof liner and sealed seams for serious protection. The shoulder strap is made of seatbelt material, which obviously makes it mighty tough. The bag is extremely durable and has proven to be waterproof, even in pouring rain. It is the first bag that I have owned that comes with a lifetime guarantee.

I'm thinking about buying the [accessory pouch](https://www.chromeindustries.com/bags/accessories/accessory-pouch.html) for quick access to my cell phone and wallet but it might be a bit small for both.

Chrome bags cost a bit more, but so far it has been worth every penny. *Highly recommended!*
