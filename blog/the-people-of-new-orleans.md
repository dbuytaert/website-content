# The people of New Orleans

I love street photography. Walking and shooting. Walking, talking and shooting. Slightly pushing me out of my comfort zone looking for that one great photo.

Street photography is all fun and games until someone pulls out a handgun. The anarchy sign in the background makes these shots complete.
