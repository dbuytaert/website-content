# A new chapter in my role at Acquia

To our valued customers, partners, and the Drupal community.

I'm excited to share an important update about my role at Acquia, the company I co-founded 17 years ago. I'm transitioning from my operational roles as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) to become Executive Chairman. In this new role, I'll remain an Acquia employee, collaborating with Steve Reny (our CEO), our Board of Directors, and our leadership team on company strategy, product vision, and M&amp;A.

This change comes at the right time for both Acquia and me. Acquia is stronger than ever, investing more in Drupal and innovation than at any point in our history. I made this decision so I can rebalance my time and focus on what matters most to me. I'm looking forward to spending more time with family and friends, as well as pursuing personal passions (including more blogging).

This change does *not* affect my commitment to Drupal or my role in the project. I will continue to lead the Drupal Project, helping to drive Drupal CMS, Drupal Core, and the Drupal Association.

Six months ago, I already chose to dedicate more of my time to Drupal. The progress we've made is remarkable. The energy in the Drupal community today is inspiring, and I'm amazed by how far we've come with [Drupal Starshot](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-starshot). I'm truly excited to continue our work together.

Thank you for your continued trust and support!
