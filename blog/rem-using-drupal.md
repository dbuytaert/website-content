# R.E.M. using Drupal

R.E.M is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) for their new [tour website](http://tour.remhq.com/) at <http://tour.remhq.com/>. They are also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com).

I don't know who built the site, but it is a good social publishing showcase. They actively encourage all R.E.M. fans to share and catalog the content they've created. They show the most recent tweets, Flickr photos, YouTube mashups, concert footage, etc. *All very cool!*
