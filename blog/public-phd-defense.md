# Public PhD defense

In exactly two weeks, I have my public PhD defense.

### Title

Profiling Techniques for Performance Analysis and Optimization of Java Applications

### Abstract

As Java applications become more complex and as virtualization becomes more important, we need to investigate profiling techniques that combine information captured at different layers of the execution stack. We present three novel profiling techniques. The central attribute of these contributions is that they link information gathered at different levels of the execution stack, and that this information is used to gather more complete profiles. By collecting information at the micro-processor level, we have profile information that is more accurate, faster to obtain, or that was otherwise not available. We show that these advances in profiling techniques lead to better understanding of program behavior and faster executing Java applications.

### Logistics

The presentation is free to attend for all, but RSVP by e-mail or in the comments. It starts at 16:00h on Thursday, January 24th, and will take place at the Jozef Plateauzaal (Jozef Plateaustraat 22, 9000 Gent).
