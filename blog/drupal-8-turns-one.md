Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of Drupal 8. On this day last year we celebrated [the release of Drupal 8](https://dri.es/drupal-8-released) with over [200 parties around the world](https://groups.drupal.org/drupal-8-release-parties). It's a project we worked on for almost five years, bringing the work of more than [3,000 contributors together](https://youtu.be/yOggQwNFl3w) to make Drupal more flexible, innovative, scalable, and easier to use.

To celebrate tomorrow's release-versary, I wanted to look back at a few of the amazing Drupal 8 projects that have launched in the past year.

The team at YMCA Greater Twin Cities turned to Drupal 8 to build OpenY, a platform that allows YMCA members to check in, set fitness goals, and book classes. They even hooked up Drupal to workout machines and wearables like Fitbit, which enables visitors to track their workouts from a Drupal 8 powered mobile app. The team at Greater Twin Cities also took advantage of Drupal 8's built-in multilingual capabilities so that other YMCAs around the world can participate. The YMCA has set a new personal record, and is a great example of what is possible with Drupal 8.

Al Jazeera is the [ largest news organization focused on the Middle East](https://dri.es/how-al-jazeera-successfully-managed-through-the-turmoil), and broadcasts news and current affairs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Al Jazeera required a platform that could unify several different content streams and support a complicated editorial workflow, allowing network wide collaboration and search. Drupal 8 allowed Al Jazeera to do that and then some. Content creators can now easily deliver critical news to their readers in real time.

### Happy 1st birthday Drupal 8!

I can't think of a better way to celebrate Drupal 8's one year anniversary than by sharing some incredible experiences that are being created with Drupal 8. Whether the project is big or small, features dinosaurs, or spreads awareness for an important cause, I'm proud to say that Drupal 8 is supporting an amazing array of projects. In my recent [keynote at DrupalCon Dublin](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2016), I explained why [the why of Drupal](https://dri.es/drupal-collective-purpose) is so important. After one year of Drupal 8, it's clear how powerful our collective purpose, projects, and passions can be.

Thank you to everyone who has continued to contribute to Drupal 8! I can't wait for another year of exciting projects. Special thanks to [Paul Johnson](https://www.drupal.org/u/pdjohnson) for crowdsourcing great examples that I wouldn't have known about otherwise.
