# Oxfam using Drupal

The flagship site of Oxfam International, <http://oxfam.org>, is using [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Oxfam is also using [Mollom](https://mollom.com) to protect [their blogs](http://blogs.oxfam.org) from comment spam. Oxfam International is a confederation of organizations actively working in more than 100 countries to find lasting solutions to poverty and injustice. I've always believed that [Oxfam was big on Plone](http://www.google.com/search?q=oxfam+plone), so I wonder why they decided to go with Drupal instead? Regardless, it's great to see that Drupal adoption continues to grow in the non-profit sector.
