It's not every day that you get to meet [so many great people](https://dri.es/foocamp-2007), or that you get to talk to [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_page) (co-founder Google). I feel overwhelmed, yet inspired, and I'm pleasantly surprised by how many people are using Drupal on this side of the planet. *Thanks O'Reilly!*
