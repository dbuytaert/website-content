Last week, we went to the [Boston Convention and Exhibition Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Convention_and_Exhibition_Center) to inspect the rooms that have been allocated to us for [DrupalCon Boston](http://boston2008.drupalcon.org). As you can see from the video above, the venue is rather nice – not to mention *humongous*. (In case you are wondering, that is Kieran Lal laughing in the background.)
