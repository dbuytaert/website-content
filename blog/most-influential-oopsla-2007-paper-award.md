# Most influential OOPSLA 2007 paper award

I was in for a nice surprise this week. Andy Georges, Lieven Eeckhout and I received an ACM SIGPLAN award for the most influential OOPSLA 2007 paper. Our paper was called "[Statistically rigorous Java performance evaluation](https://dri.es/files/oopsla07-georges.pdf)" and was published 10 years ago at the OOPSLA conference. It helped set a standard for benchmarking the performance of Java applications. A quick look on the ACM website shows that our paper has been cited [156 times](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297033). The award was totally unexpected, but much appreciated. As much as I love my current job, thinking back to some of my PhD research makes me miss my academic work. *Congratulations Andy and Lieven!*
