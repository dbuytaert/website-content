# Drupal 7 released

Today, 3 years after the Drupal 6.0 release, [we released Drupal 7.0](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.0) to the world. It is easier to use, more flexible, more scalable and 100% Open Source.

Drupal powers 1% of all the web sites in the world; with all the improvements in Drupal 7, I expect that number to go up.

About 1,000 people contributed to Drupal 7. It is a legendary piece of work, by the community, for the community. On Friday, we celebrate the release with [248 parties in 88 countries](http://www.drupal7releaseparty.org/). Make sure to buy these people a drink.
