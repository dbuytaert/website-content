# Party with Varnish

Anyone who runs a high-availability [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) site knows about [Varnish](http://www.varnish-cache.org), the open-source HTTP reverse-proxy server. Varnish intercepts requests before they hit the web server and delivers relevant information that it finds in its cache, resulting in lower loads and radically faster pages.

We love Varnish at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com). It's one of the ingredients that makes [Acquia Dev Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/acquia-dev-cloud) and [Acquia Managed Cloud](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/managed-cloud) so fast.

This Thursday, the Varnish team will [celebrate the release of Varnish 3.0](http://varnish-cache.org/) with parties around the world, much as the Drupal community [celebrated the release of Drupal 7](https://dri.es/drupal-7-to-be-released-on-january-5th-with-one-ginormous-party).

Because we love Varnish, Acquia is organizing and sponsoring two Varnish release parties. One is in Boston, at the [Cambridge Brewing Company](http://www.cambridgebrewingcompany.com/) from 6:30 to 8:30pm; a second is in Portland at the [Lucky Labrador Brewing Company](http://www.luckylab.com) starting at 6:00pm. Both are on Thursday, June 16th. See the [Varnish 3.0 party page](http://v3party.varnish-cache.org) for parties at locations near you.

It's a great opportunity to meet fellow web geeks and have some good (free!) beer. I'll be at the Boston party, and look forward to seeing the local Varnish users!

Further details are [on Varnish's web site](http://v3party.varnish-cache.org). See you this Thursday!
