I'm very proud to announce we've just taken the "beta" label of [Mollom](https://mollom.com), [the startup Benjamin Schrauwen and I began to help keep your website free of spam](https://dri.es/mollom-my-content-monitoring-startup), and that we made our first commercial product available. In the six months we've been beta-testing Mollom, we've blocked [almost 9 million spam messages on thousands of sites](https://www.mollom.com/scorecard). Starting today, we intend to block many, many more.

As promised, our most basic service is still free. We make *Mollom Free* available for free because we think that making spam protection available to as many sites as possible is the right thing to do. While Mollom Free is a great fit for the vast majority of our install base, it is limited to 100 legitimate posts or comments it can process per day. For larger sites, our *Mollom Plus* service is a great solution, providing protection against post and comment spam for about 1 euro per day. Supporting a volume of 10,000 legitimate posts per day, and backed-up by multiple Mollom servers in data centers around the world, Mollom Plus is designed for the needs of large community sites, web businesses and enterprise sites. For the largest sites – or for customers who have many sites to protect – we're also rolling out volume licensing. More details regarding Mollom Plus, Mollom Free, and other service plan options are available on the [Mollom pricing page](https://www.mollom.com/pricing) and in the [Mollom FAQ](https://www.mollom.com/faq).

Even if you don't have a large site and you hate spam as much as we do and believe that Mollom's services have reduced the amount of time you're spending policing your content, consider a Mollom Plus subscription to help support our efforts to fight spam. *Thanks!*
