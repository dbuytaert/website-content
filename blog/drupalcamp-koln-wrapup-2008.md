Last weekend, I attended [DrupalCamp Köln](https://dri.es/drupalcamp-koln-2008) in Germany. It was great to put my feelers out in the German Drupal community and to talk with so many Drupal users and developers. Executive summary: the German Drupal community is going strong. *Thank you for your hospitality!*
