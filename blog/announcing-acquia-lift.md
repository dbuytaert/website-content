# Announcing Acquia Lift

Today, the web is not just about publishing content anymore. As [the web evolves from content management to digital experience management](https://dri.es/from-content-management-to-digital-experience-management), it's about understanding visitors' interests and preferences, and figuring out how to deliver them an optimal personalized experience. Many organizations are exploring ways to more effectively create and deliver valuable content to site visitors to increase traffic, conversions and revenue. Great content is still gold, but delivering the right content to the right user at the right moment in the right format is platinum.

Today's personalization tools aren't great and put marketers at a disadvantage. This is why I'm excited to announce that we're rolling out [Acquia Lift](https://www.acquia.com//products-services/website-personalization), a solution that equips the site owners with powerful website testing and content targeting tools to optimize content for each visitor. Acquia Lift learns about a visitor's interests and, based on these insights, uses machine learning algorithms to automate the delivery of personalized content. Marketers and site builders can test content, for example using A/B or multivariate testing, and even add rules about the types of user profiles that get specific content. There is implicit learning that takes place as well that continuously helps Acquia Lift provide increasingly more appropriate content to individuals. Attributes of the user, such as location, and even what the current weather is, can be taken into account in providing the right content.

As [I talked and wrote about earlier](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2013), I believe personalization and contextualization will be a critical building block of the future of the web, and I'm excited to help make that a reality.
