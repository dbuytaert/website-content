SourceForge, Inc (formerly VA Linux/Software, [NASDAQ: LNUX](http://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:LNUX)) switched [their corporate website](http://sourceforge.com) to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Another public company with a Drupal site!

[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.com) operates many of the sites that had a huge impact on my early Open Source career, including [SourceForge.net](http://sf.net) (the world's largest open source software development and distribution environment), [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) (the web destination that pioneered community generated content and that provided inspiration for [some of the features in Drupal 1.0](https://dri.es/happy-fifth-birthday-drupal)), [ThinkGeek](https://thinkgeek.com) (my favorite online shop of cool stuff and whose t-shirts turned me into a walking Open Source <strike>billboard</strike> evangelist), [NewsForge](http://newsforge.com) (who published [an instrumental Drupal 4.7 review](https://dri.es/newsforge-reviews-drupal-4.7)), [Linux.com](https://linux.com) (who published [many great Drupal articles](http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Alinux.com+drupal)), [freshmeat.net](https://freshmeat.net) (where I publicly announced Drupal 1.0 on January 15, 2001; e.g. [check this comment from 2001](http://freshmeat.net/projects/drupal#comment-9885) on [the Drupal Freshmeat page](http://freshmeat.net/projects/drupal/)), and more. And last but not least, VA Linux's IPO (now SourceForge, Inc) helped make Linux a success, which is [how I got involved with Open Source development in the first place](https://dri.es/files/wlan-faq.html). *Fantastic news!*
