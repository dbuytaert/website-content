Drupal continues to [rock the newspaper and magazine world](https://vimeo.com/979664). [Femina](http://femina.ch), a women's magazine, recently switched to [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Femina is owned by [Edipresse](http://www.edipresse.com), one of Europe's biggest media and communications companies. They publish more than 200 titles, including some leading European newspapers (i.e. [Le Matin](https://www.lematin.ch/), [Le Temps](https://www.letemps.ch/), [24 heures](https://www.24heures.ch/)).

Edipresse is known to use [eZ publish](https://ez.no/) for many of the group's websites. In fact, [Femina](http://femina.ch) used to run on eZ publish as well. I don't know the details but maybe more Edipresse websites will be Drupal-ized?
