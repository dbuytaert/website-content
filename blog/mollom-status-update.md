# Mollom status update

As you might have read, [Wim Leers](https://wimleers.com/) (long term [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) contributor) is a summer intern at [Mollom](https://mollom.com). After 6 months of public beta testing, and after having blocked [more than 5 million spam messages for more than 2,500 users](https://www.mollom.com/scorecard), we're getting ready to open our doors for business. While Ben and I continue to focus on the spam classifiers and the [various Mollom plugins](https://www.mollom.com/download), Wim is helping us to get ready for launch by implementing a payment system and more.

More details about our pricing structure will follow shortly, but as promised, Mollom will remain freely available for both commercial and non-commercial use. The free version of Mollom will be limited in volume and features though. We want as many people to benefit from Mollom as possible so our goal is to make Mollom free for at least 95% of our install base. In other words, the free version of Mollom will go well beyond meeting the needs of the average site owner. Like so, we hope to make a significant contribution to fighting the spam problem online. More details shortly.
