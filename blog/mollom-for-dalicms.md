# Mollom for DaliCMS

[DaliCMS](http://dalicms.org) in an Open Source Web 2.0 content management system based on [Glassfish](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/), Sun's Open Source application server written in Java. DaliCMS is developed by [LodgON](http://www.lodgon.com) and ships with Mollom support out of the box. Instructions on how to configure Mollom are available [on this DaliCMS project page](https://dalicms.dev.java.net/alm-process/1-Developer%20Documentation/Mollom%20spam%20checking%20in%20DaliCMS/). *Thanks LodgON!*
