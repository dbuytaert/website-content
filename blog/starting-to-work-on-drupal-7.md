# Starting to work on Drupal 7

Drupal 6 has been in a code freeze for more than 6 months and is almost ready to be released now. We're only a few bug fixes away from the Drupal 6.0 release. Therefore, I just created the `DRUPAL-6` CVS branch for Drupal core. This means that while Drupal 6 is being finalized and we prepare for the Drupal 6.0 release, we'll also start accepting new features and improvements for Drupal 7, the next major version of Drupal.

In my [State of Drupal presentation in Barcelona](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-september-2007) I hinted about what would be the *killer Drupal 7 release* according to a survey I conducted. While that list is not exclusive and nothing but a wishlist (not a deliverable), it might be worth a look if you want to help shape the future of Drupal.

If you don't want to watch the entire video, here is the executive summary:

1. Better media handling
2. Custom content types in core
3. WYSIWYG editor
4. Better performance
5. Better tools to structure/organize content
6. Basic Views like module
7. Automatic upgrade functionality
8. Improved node access system
9. Better internal APIs
10. Better external APIs (import/export, web services)
11. Usability

Expect me to blog more about these in the next couple of months.
