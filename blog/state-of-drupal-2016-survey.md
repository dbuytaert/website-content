# State of Drupal 2016 survey

I've been writing a lot about what I believe is important for the future of Drupal, but now it is your turn. After every major release of Drupal I do a "product management survey" to get your ideas and data on what to focus on for future releases of Drupal (8.x/9).

The last time we had such a survey was after the release of Drupal 7, six months into the development of Drupal 8. I presented the results at [DrupalCon London in 2011](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-august-2011). The results informed the Drupal community at large, but were also the basis for [defining initiatives for Drupal 8](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-august-2011.pdf). This time around, I'm hoping for similar impact, but also some higher-level strategic thinking about how Drupal should respond to various market trends.

[Take the State of Drupal 2016 survey now](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/drupal-2016)

It shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes to fill out the survey. We'd like to hear from everyone who cares about Drupal: content managers, site owners, site builders, module developers, front-end developers, people selling and marketing Drupal, etc. Whether you are a Drupal expert or just getting started with Drupal, every voice counts! Best of all, with Drupal 8's new 6-month release cycle, we can act on the results of this survey much sooner than in the past.

I will be presenting the results during my DrupalCon New Orleans keynote (the video recording of the keynote, the presentation slides and the survey results will be downloadable on my blog after). Please [tell us what you think about Drupal](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/drupal-2016); your feedback will shape future versions of Drupal.
