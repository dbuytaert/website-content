# CMS usage

Between June 15th and July 15th, [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/) and [Ektron](http://www.ektron.com/) conducted a survey about the state of web development. In total 5,000 web professionals took the survey and the [results are made available in a yearly report](https://www.sitepoint.com/report2006/). One of the questions was: *for your web projects, what is the primary type of web content management system (CMS) you use?*
