# State of Drupal presentation (September 2016)

DrupalCon Dublin marked my 28th DrupalCon and #Driesnote presentation. You can [watch a recording of my keynote](https://youtu.be/eQLzrlMeySU) (starting at 23:55) or [download a copy of my slides here](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-september-2016.pdf) (185.4 MB).

The first half of the presentation I provided a technical update on Drupal 8. I showcased some of the big changes in Drupal 8.2 such as the [settings tray](https://youtu.be/n53WD0odm7Q), [REST API improvements](https://youtu.be/n53WD0odm7Q), [migration tool improvements](https://youtu.be/3KDff8iX2x0), and [easier to use block placement](https://youtu.be/Osbegr_d_GY). I also talked about [how we've transformed Drupal 8 for continuous innovation](https://dri.es/the-transformation-of-drupal-8-for-continuous-innovation). I'm super excited about our improved development process and release cycle, as it helps us ship innovative updates to Drupal 8 faster and with a much easier upgrade path.

The second half of the talk focused on "The why" of Drupal, and asked an important question for all of us to think about: [what is Drupal's collective purpose](https://dri.es/drupal-collective-purpose)? In addition to me talking about my own purpose, my team interviewed Drupal people around the world about their passion and purpose.
