I have never done much cooking in my life. I prepare the occasional spaghetti bolognese, but that is about it. And when I say "prepare", I mean that I heat up pre-cooked bolognese sauce.

Either way, to start off the new year in style, I set out to make my first soup ever. From scratch. I decided on broccoli cream soup as that is one of my favorite soups, and it only involved vegetables.

Guess what? The soup was delicious. There might be a chef in me! ;-)
