I'm turning 35 today. 35 is a weird age. It feels like a milestone birthday; like I'm turning the corner into adulthood for good. Turning 35, it seems, is not without complications. I feel like I became part of the old folk whose cool is threatened by youngsters. Anxious, as I've so much left to achieve and experience.

And yet, I am following my passions and there is not much more I'd want. People have asked me what I'd like for my birthday. I'd love it if you gave me one of the following two things:

1. Give me [the gift of a patch](https://www.drupal.org/getting-involved-guide). I'd love to see [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/8%20) come to fruition while I'm 35. Drupal 8 will help make a meaningful difference in the world.
2. Give [a donation to Drupal's Movember team](https://us.movember.com/team/1188185) to help fight prostate and testicular cancer. Cancer is a murderer, and I'd like to see it go away.
