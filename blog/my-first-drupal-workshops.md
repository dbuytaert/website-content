For the first time in my Drupal career, I'll help teach two Drupal workshops.

The first Drupal workshop is organized by [Roel De Meester](http://www.develoop.be/) as part of the [Belgian Drupal User Group](http://drupal.be/) activities. The workshop will take place in Antwerp, next Saturday, March 10th. It is targeted at people who are new to Drupal: we'll show you how to install and configure a Drupal site but deliberately won't cover any advanced developer topics. The workshop is free to attend but seating is limited so hurry up and check [Roel's announcement](http://www.develoop.be/free_training) for more information.

The second Drupal workshop that I'll assist with is the [Drupal performance and scalability workshop](https://www.lullabot.com/seminar/drupal_performance_and_scalability/sunnyvale_ca_2007) organized by [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/). At the workshop, James Walker ([Bryght](http://bryght.com/)), Jeremy Andrews ([CivicSpace](http://civicspacelabs.org/)), Matt Westgate ([Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/)) and myself will share tips and information on getting the maximum performance out of Drupal and the infrastructure that your Drupal site runs on. The workshop takes place on March 24th, directly after the [Open Source CMS Summit at Yahoo!](https://dri.es/open-source-cms-summit-at-yahoo) in Sunnyvale, California. It is not free but all profits from this seminar will be donated to the [Drupal Association](https://dri.es/drupal-association-launched). (We're not getting paid for it.)

Why am I doing this? Because I think it is fun, and because it is a great opportunity to learn from what Drupal users have to say.
