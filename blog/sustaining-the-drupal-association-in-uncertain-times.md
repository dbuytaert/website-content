# Sustaining the Drupal Association in uncertain times

[image drupal/blue-hearts-1]

Today, I'm asking for your financial support for the [Drupal Association](https://www.drupal.org/association/). As we all know, we are living in unprecedented times, and the Drupal Association needs our help. With DrupalCon being postponed or potentially canceled, there will be a significant financial impact on our beloved non-profit.

Over the past twenty years, the Drupal project has weathered many storms, including financial crises. Every time, Drupal has come out stronger. As I wrote last week, I'm confident that [Drupal and Open Source will weather the current storm as well](https://dri.es/is-open-source-recession-proof).

While [the future for Drupal and Open Source is in no doubt](https://dri.es/is-open-source-recession-proof), the picture is not as clear for the Drupal Association.

Thirteen years ago, six years after I started Drupal, [the Drupal Association was formed](https://dri.es/drupal-association-launched). As an Open Source non-profit, the Drupal Association's mission was to help grow and sustain the Drupal community. It still has that same mission today. The Drupal Association plays a critical role in Drupal's success: it manages [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/), hosts Open Source collaboration tools, and brings the community together at events around the world.

The Drupal Association's biggest challenge in the current crisis is to figure out what to do about DrupalCon Minneapolis. The [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) has caused the Drupal Association to [postpone or perhaps even cancel DrupalCon Minneapolis](https://events.drupal.org/minneapolis2020/coronavirus-covid-19-disease-public-health-information-update-mar-18).

With over 3,000 attendees, DrupalCon is not only the Drupal community's main event – it's also the most important financial lever to support the Drupal Association and the staff, services, and infrastructure they provide to the Drupal project. Despite efforts to diversify its revenue model, the Drupal Association remains highly dependent on DrupalCon.

No matter what happens with DrupalCon, there will be a significant financial impact to the Drupal Association. The Drupal Association is now in a position where it needs to find between $400,000 and $1.1 million USD depending on if we postpone or cancel the event.

In these trying times, the best of Drupal's worldwide community is already shining through. Some organizations and individuals *proactively* informed the Drupal Association that they could keep their sponsorship dollars or ticket price whether or not DrupalCon North America happens this year: [Lullabot](https://www.lullabot.com/), [Centarro](https://www.centarro.io/), [FFW](https://ffwagency.com/), [Palantir.net](https://www.palantir.net/), [Amazee Group](https://amazee.com/) and [Contegix](https://www.contegix.com/) have come forward to pledge that they will not request a refund of their DrupalCon Minneapolis sponsorship, even if it will be cancelled. [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/), my company, has joined in this campaign as well, and will not request a refund of its DrupalCon sponsorship either.

These are great examples of forward-thinking leadership and action, and is what makes our community so special. Not only do these long-time Drupal Association sponsors understand that the entire Drupal project benefits from the resources the Drupal Association provides for us – they also anticipated the financial needs the Drupal Association is working hard to understand, model and mitigate.

In order to preserve the Drupal Association, not just DrupalCon, [more financial help is needed](https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/drupal-association-statement-re-financial-effects-of-covid-19):

- Consider [making a donation](https://www.drupal.org/association/donate) to the Drupal Association.
- Other DrupalCon sponsors can consider this year's sponsorship as a contribution and not seek a refund should the event be cancelled, postponed or changed.
- Individuals can consider [becoming a member](https://www.drupal.org/association/support), increasing their membership level, or submitting an additional donation.

I encourage everyone in the Drupal community, including our large enterprise users, to come together and find creative ways to help the Drupal Association and each other. All contributions are highly valued.

The Drupal Association is not alone. This pandemic has wreaked havoc not only on other technology conferences, but on many organizations' fundamental ability to host conferences at all moving forward.

I want to thank all donors, contributors, volunteers, the Drupal Association staff, and the Drupal Association Board of Directors for helping us work through this. It takes commitment, leadership and courage to weather any storm, especially a storm of the current magnitude. *Thank you!*
