Today, 8 months after the Drupal 4.7 release, we released Drupal 5.0 to the world. Drupal 4.0 was released in 2002 so it took us a few year to feel confident to increase the major version number from 4 to 5. Needless to say, Drupal 5 is our most exciting release to date. Read more about Drupal 5.0 in the [official release announcement](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-5.0) or just look at the ["what is new in Drupal 5.0?" screencast](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/drupal/files/videocasts/5-whats-new.mp4) (13 Mb, 10 min, mp4) that we prepared. *Rock on, Drupal community!*
