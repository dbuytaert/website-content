# Community in the 21st century

[video NorfgQlEJv8]

[Eben Moglen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eben_Moglen) (Professor of Law and General Counsel for the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/)) delivered an incredibly interesting keynote at the Plone conference.

Eben explained the [Plone community](http://plone.org) why he thinks that managing content is not important, and why managing community is. He believes that community-driven development will become increasingly popular and vastly superior compared to software developed by a single commercial entity. Hence the need for software and infrastructure that allow organizations to build large communities for a certain period of time.

*We are moving to a world in which in the 21st century the most important activities that produce, occur not in factories, and not by individual initiative, but in communities, held together by software.*
