Today is bittersweet for the [Drupal Association](https://association.drupal.org), as [Jacob Redding has transitioned the Executive Director role to Holly Ross](https://dri.es/holly-ross-to-join-drupal-association-as-executive-director). Jacob did a phenomenal job growing the Drupal Association, Drupal.org and Drupal as a whole. Jacob's special attention to the community has helped create a culture that many of us are proud to be a part of; his passion and dedication for Drupal has always been evident.

Under Jacob's leadership we have broadened our activities, streamlined operations and significantly increased revenues. The Drupal community members grew by 1143% to 800,000 and we gained 3286% more committers to 23,000 in just three years. That said, our DrupalCon sizes and attendance expanded, which has helped increase Drupal adoption throughout the world. The Drupal Association staff of 12 has settled into Portland and is well positioned in Oregon's active open source community.

With Holly onboard, our vision remains to become the largest open source, non-profit organization that continually increases its support to the community and project. Jacob, thank you for all your hard work and tenacity! I look forward to continuing to work with you in the community.
