Ten years ago, [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) shut down Drupal Gardens, a decision that I still regret.

We had launched Drupal Gardens in 2009 as a SaaS platform that let anyone build [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) websites without touching code. Long-time readers may remember my [various blog posts](https://dri.es/tag/drupal-gardens) about it.

It was pretty successful. Within a year, 20,000 sites were running on Drupal Gardens. By the time we shut it down, more than 100,000 sites used the platform.

Looking back, shutting down Drupal Gardens feels like one of the biggest business mistakes we made.

At the time, we were a young company with limited resources, and we faced a classic startup dilemma. Drupal Gardens was a true SaaS platform. Sites launched in minutes, and customers never had to think about updates or infrastructure. Enterprise customers loved that simplicity, but they also needed capabilities we hadn't built yet: custom integrations, fleet management, advanced governance, and more. 

For a while, we tried to serve both markets. We kept Drupal Gardens running for simple sites while evolving parts of it into [what became Acquia Cloud Site Factory](https://dri.es/announcing-acquia-cloud-site-factory) for enterprise customers. But with our limited resources, maintaining both paths wasn't sustainable. We had to choose: continue making Drupal easier for simple use cases, or focus on enterprise customers.

We chose enterprise. Seeing stronger traction with larger organizations, we shut down the original Drupal Gardens and doubled down on Site Factory. By traditional business metrics, we made the right decision.  Acquia Cloud Site Factory remains a core part of Acquia's business today and is used by hundreds of customers that run large site fleets with advanced governance requirements, deep custom integrations, and close collaboration with development teams.

But that decision also moved us away from the original Drupal Gardens promise: serving the marketer or site owner who didn't want or need a developer team. Acquia Cloud Site Factory requires technical expertise, whereas Drupal Gardens did not.

For the next ten years, I watched many organizations struggle with the very challenge Drupal Gardens could have solved. Large organizations often want one platform that can support both simple and complex sites. Without a modern Drupal-based SaaS, many turned to WordPress or other SaaS tools for their smaller sites, and kept Drupal only for their most complex properties.

The problem is that a multi-CMS environment comes with a real cost. Teams must learn different systems, juggle different authoring experiences, manage siloed content, and maintain multiple technology stacks. It can slow them down and make digital operations harder than they need to be. Yet many organizations continue to accept this complexity simply because there has not been a better option.

Over the years, I spoke with many customers who ran a mix of Drupal and non-Drupal sites. They echoed these frustrations in conversation after conversation. Those discussions reminded me of what we had left behind with Drupal Gardens: many organizations want to standardize on a single CMS like Drupal, but the market hadn't offered a solution that made that possible.

So, why start a new Drupal SaaS after all these years? Because the customer need never went away, and we finally have the resources. We are no longer the young company forced to choose.

Jeff Bezos famously advised investing in what was true ten years ago, is true today, and will be true ten years from now. His framework applies to two realities here.

First, organizations will always need websites of different sizes and complexity. A twenty-page campaign site launching tomorrow has little in common with a flagship digital experience under continuous development. Second, running multiple, different technology stacks is rarely efficient. These truths have held for decades, and they're not going away.  

This is why we've been building Acquia Source for the past eighteen months. We haven't officially launched it yet, although you may have seen us begin to talk about it more openly. For now, we're testing Acquia Source with select customers through a limited availability program. 

Acquia Source is more powerful and more customizable than Drupal Gardens ever was. Drupal has changed significantly in the past ten years, and so has what we can deliver.  While Drupal Gardens aimed for mass adoption, Acquia Source is built for organizations that can afford a more premium solution.

As with Drupal Gardens, we are building Acquia Source with open principles in mind. It is easy to export your site, including code, configuration, and content.

Just as important, we are building key parts of Acquia Source in the open. A good example is Drupal Canvas. Drupal Canvas is open source, and we are developing it transparently with the community. 

Acquia Source does _not_ replace Acquia Cloud or Acquia Cloud Site Factory. It complements them. Many organizations will use a combination of these products, and some will use all three. Acquia Source helps teams launch sites fast, without updates or maintenance. Acquia Cloud and Site Factory support deeply integrated applications and large, governed site fleets. The common foundation is Drupal, which allows IT and marketing teams to share skills and code across different environments.

For me, Acquia Source is more than a new product. It finally delivers on [a vision we've had for fifteen years](https://dri.es/acquia-product-strategy-and-vision): one platform that can support everything from simple sites to the most complex ones.  

I am excited about what this means for our customers, and I am equally excited about what it could mean for Drupal. It can strengthen Drupal's position in the market, bring more sites back to Drupal, and create even more opportunities for Acquia to contribute to Drupal.
