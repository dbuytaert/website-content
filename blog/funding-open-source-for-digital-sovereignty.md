# Funding Open Source for Digital Sovereignty

[image blog/open-source-makers-and-takers-7 priority=false schema=false]

As global tensions rise, governments are waking up to the fact that they've lost *digital sovereignty*. They depend on foreign companies that can change terms, cut off access, or be weaponized against them. A decision in Washington can disable services in Brussels overnight. 

Last year, the [International Criminal Court ditched Microsoft 365](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/31/international_criminal_court_ditches_office/) after a dispute over access to the chief prosecutor's email. Denmark's [Ministry of Digitalisation is moving to LibreOffice](https://www.computing.co.uk/news/2025/denmark-digital-ministry-drops-microsoft). And Germany's state of [Schleswig-Holstein is migrating 30,000 workstations off Microsoft](https://www.heise.de/en/news/Goodbye-Microsoft-Schleswig-Holstein-relies-on-Open-Source-and-saves-millions-11105459.html).

Reclaiming digital sovereignty doesn't require building the European equivalent of Microsoft or Google. That approach hasn't worked in the past, and there is no time to make it work now. Fortunately, Europe has something else: some of the world's strongest Open Source communities, regulatory reach, and public sector scale.

Open Source is the most credible path to digital sovereignty. It's the only software you can run without permission. You can audit, host, modify, and migrate it yourself. No vendor, no government, and no sanctions regime can ever take it away.

Though as I discuss in [The Software Sovereignty Scale](https://dri.es/the-software-sovereignty-scale), some Open Source licenses offer stronger structural guarantees than others.

But there is a catch. When governments buy Open Source services, the money rarely reaches the people who actually build and maintain it. Procurement rules favor large system integrators, not the maintainers of the software itself. As a result, public money flows to companies that package and resell Open Source, not to the ones who do the hard work of writing and sustaining it.

I've watched this pattern repeat for over two decades in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), the Open Source project I started and that is now widely used across European governments. 

A small web agency spends months building a new feature. They design it, implement it, and shepherd it through review until it's merged. Then the government puts out a tender for a new website, and that feature is a critical requirement. A much larger company, with no involvement in Drupal, submits a polished proposal. They have the references, the sales team, and the compliance certifications. They win the contract. The feature exists because the small agency built it. But apart from new maintenance obligations, the original authors get nothing in return.

Public money flows around Open Source instead of into it. Multiply that by every Open Source project in Europe's software stack, and you start to see both the scale of the problem and the scale of the opportunity. Open Source is [public infrastructure](/funding-open-source-like-public-infrastructure) but we don't fund it that way.

This is the pattern we need to break. Governments should be contracting with Open Source maintainers, not middlemen.

<p class="pullquote">Public money flows around Open Source instead of into it. Governments should contract with Open Source maintainers and builders, not middlemen who merely resell it.</p>

Skipping the maintainers is not just unfair, it is bad governance. Vendors who do not contribute upstream can still deliver projects, but they are much less effective at fixing problems at the source or shaping the software's future. You end up spending public money on short-term integration, while underinvesting in the long-term quality, security, and resilience of the software you depend on.

If Europe wants digital sovereignty and real innovation, procurement must invest in upstream maintainers where security, resilience, and new capabilities are actually built.

The fix is straightforward: *make contribution count in procurement scoring*. When evaluating vendors, ask what they put back into the Open Source projects they are selling. Code, documentation, security fixes, funding.

Of course, all vendors will claim they contribute. I've seen companies claim credit for work they barely touched, or count contributions from employees who left years ago.

So how does a procurement officer tell who is real? By letting Open Source projects vouch for contributors directly. Projects know who does the work. 

We built [Drupal's credit system](https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem) to solve for exactly this. It's not perfect, but it's transparent. And transparency is hard to fake.

We use the credit system to maintain a [public directory of companies that provide Drupal services](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-services), ranked by their contributions. It shows, at a glance, which companies actually help build and maintain Drupal. 

If a vendor isn't on that list, they're likely not contributing in any meaningful way. For a procurement officer, this turns a hard judgment call into a simple check: you can see who builds Drupal. This is what contribution-based procurement looks like in practice.

Fortunately, the momentum is building. APELL, an association of European Open Source companies, has [proposed making contribution a procurement criterion](https://apell.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-03_Feedback%20APELL_Cloud%20and%20AI%20Development%20Act%20consultation.pdf). [EuroStack](https://eurostack.eu), a coalition of 260+ companies, is lobbying for a "Buy Open Source Act". The European Commission has embraced an [Open Source roadmap](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/thematic-roadmap-open-source-and-inputs-common-trust-principles) with procurement recommendations.

Europe does not need to build the next hyperscaler. It needs to shift procurement toward Open Source builders and maintainers. If Europe gets this right, it will mean better software, stronger local vendors, and public money that actually builds public code. Not to mention the autonomy that comes with it.

*I submitted this post as feedback to the European Commission's call for evidence on [Towards European Open Digital Ecosystems](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/16213-European-Open-Digital-Ecosystems_en). If you work in Open Source, consider adding your voice. The feedback period ends February 3, 2026.*
