Last week it was [Red Nose Day](http://www.rednoseday.com), a UK-wide fundraising event organized by [Comic Relief](http://www.comicrelief.com) every two years. A combination of television programs, local community events, social media and Drupal websites were used to raise £75 million ($113 million) in one day. On Red Nose Day everyone is encouraged to cast inhibitions aside, put on a Red Nose and do something funny for money. The money is used to make a difference to the lives of countless people across Africa and the UK who are facing terrible injustice or living in desperate poverty.

[Rednoseday.com](http://www.rednoseday.com) and [Comicrelief.com](http://www.comicrelief.com) are built in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) and the [Acquia team](https://www.acquia.com) have been supporting their talented web team with Drupal expertise and use of the Acquia Cloud to ensure a stable and massively scalable platform.

During the live show there were massive peaks in website traffic and every hour there were special heartfelt appeals within the program which results in a frenzy of donations. To deal with the sudden, massive spikes (they call them 'slams'), we had to employ 24 load balancers, 28 web heads and 2 database servers. We had an additional 12 load balancers and 2 web nodes ready for failover. This happens so quickly that it would not give you enough time to spin up additional servers once the traffic starts to ramp up. Along with the hardware, Acquia had 11 people helping with the infrastructure the night of the event.

As you can imagine, there is nothing like a live, six-hour televised national charity event where millions of dollars are at risk, to put fear into the hearts of any web team. To be able to do help inspiring charities such as Comic Relief gives the entire Acquia team an exceptional sense of accomplishment. I am very proud of their dedication and commitment to this project.

In fact, we've been doing our bit with some Harlem Shake videos from both our [Reading (UK)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgEbiF4nqgA&feature=youtu.be) and [Burlington (US)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pglkRMEOyiQ) offices to raise donations. It's not too late to help this tremendously worthwhile and life changing cause: <https://www.comicrelief.com/rednoseday>.
