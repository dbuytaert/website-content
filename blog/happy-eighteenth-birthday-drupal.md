Eighteen years ago today, I released Drupal 1.0.0. What started from humble beginnings has grown into one of the largest Open Source communities in the world. Today, Drupal exists because of its people and the collective effort of thousands of community members. Thank you to everyone who has been and continues to contribute to Drupal.

Eighteen years is also the voting age in the US, and the legal drinking age in Europe. I'm not sure which one is better. :) Joking aside, welcome to adulthood, Drupal. May your day be bug free and filled with fresh patches!
