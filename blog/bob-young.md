# Bob Young

Thanks to [Kolgen &amp; Laenen](http://www.kandl.be/), I had the opportunity to meet [Bob Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Young) last night. For those who don't know Bob Young, he's the former CEO of [RedHat](http://redhat.com), one of the biggest open source companies in the world, and the founder of [Lulu.com](https://www.lulu.com/), a print-on-demand books service for do-it-yourselfers. Lulu.com is a service that you'll want to keep an eye on ...

Bob is smart, funny, knew about Drupal, and repeatedly called [Kris](http://www.x-tend.be/~kb/blog/) and myself "young kids". *Well, thanks Bob! ;-)*
