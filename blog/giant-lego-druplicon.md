# Giant Lego Druplicon

I'm proud to announce Acquia's newest member of the team, the LEGO Druplicon, courtesy of [DataFlow](https://www.ausy.be/) (now [ONE Agency](http://www.one-agency.be)). It all started on a hot August day at DrupalCon Munich. On that day, [I stopped by DataFlow's booth](https://twitter.com/ausybelgium/status/238297341524848640) to look at this amazing piece of art. Obviously I am a bit partial to the Druplicon and the innovative and creative ways people around the world are creating branding for Drupal.

Little did I know some lucky DrupalCon attendee was going to win the Druplicon by guessing how many bricks DataFlow used to build it. After asking a couple of questions, such as "Is it a solid structure or hollow?", I entered my guess (along with 94 other Drupalists). My mathematical equation brought me to the answer of 12,222 blocks, which was 9 blocks over the correct number of 12,213. I won!

DataFlow went to great lengths to ship the delicate, yet massive structure from Belgium to the United States. After contacting numerous courier companies and hearing the Druplicon needed a special Visa, VAT and insurance documents, as well as it needed to be fumigated (sigh, it's just LEGOs), they found one company that was willing to take on the task. About a month and half later, [a pallet jack wheeled into our office](https://twitter.com/i/#!/Dries/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FGrQzzVSe) and dropped off a 4 foot crate.

Unfortunately due to my travel schedule I wasn't able to open the crate for about a week, which created quite the buzz around the office. We had to [schedule the unveiling](https://twitter.com/i/#!/Dries/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FasvdmNkP) and make sure we had a crowbar and hammer on hand to open it. Coincidentally this was on my birthday, so it was quite the gift!

I'm happy to report that the 12,213 LEGO Drupalicon made it intact (just a few pieces came loose) due to the wonderful packing material of Belgian toilet paper! I probably don't have to buy toilet paper for a year now. :-)

A huge thanks goes out to [DataFlow](https://www.ausy.be/) who spent the time replicating the Druplicon in LEGOs, as well as shipping it over the Atlantic. We are in the process of finding a permanent spot for it in the Acquia office, so it's on display for everyone to see.
