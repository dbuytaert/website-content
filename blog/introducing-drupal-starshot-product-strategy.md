# Introducing Drupal Starshot's product strategy

[image drupal/starshot-strategy]

I'm excited to share the first version of [Drupal Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot)'s product strategy, a document that aims to guide the development and marketing of Drupal Starshot. To read it, download the full [Drupal Starshot strategy document](https://dri.es/files/drupal-starshot-product-strategy-1.pdf) as a PDF (8 MB).

This strategy document is the result of a collaborative effort among the [Drupal Starshot leadership team](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-starshot-leadership-team), the [Drupal Starshot Advisory Council](https://dri.es/announcing-the-drupal-starshot-advisory-council), and the [Drupal Core Committers](https://www.drupal.org/community/contributor-guide/role/drupal-core-committer). We also tested it with marketers who provided feedback and validation.

### Drupal Starshot and Drupal Core

[Drupal Starshot](https://www.drupal.org/about/starshot) is the temporary name for an initiative that extends the capabilities of Drupal Core. Drupal Starshot aims to broaden Drupal's appeal to marketers and a wider range of project budgets. Our ultimate goal is to increase Drupal's adoption, solidify Drupal's position as a leading CMS, and champion an [Open Web](https://dri.es/tag/open-web).

For more context, please watch my [DrupalCon Portland keynote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-may-2024).

It's important to note that Drupal Starshot and Drupal Core will have separate, yet complementary, product strategies. Drupal Starshot will focus on empowering marketers and expanding Drupal's presence in the mid-market, while Drupal Core will prioritize the needs of developers and more technical users. I'll write more about the Drupal Core product strategy in a future blog post once we have finalized it. Together, these two strategies will form a comprehensive vision for Drupal as a product.

### Why a product strategy?

By defining our goals, target audience and necessary features, we can more effectively guide contributors and ensure that everyone is working towards a common vision. This product strategy will serve as a foundation for our development roadmap, our marketing efforts, enabling Drupal Certified Partners, and more.

### Drupal Starshot product strategy TL;DR

For the detailed product strategy, please read the full [Drupal Starshot strategy document](https://dri.es/files/drupal-starshot-product-strategy-1.pdf) (8 MB, PDF). Below is a summary.

Drupal Starshot aims to be the gold standard for marketers that want to build great digital experiences.

We'd like to expand Drupal's reach by focusing on two strategic shifts:

1. Prioritizing Drupal for content creators, marketers, web managers, and web designers so they can independently build websites. A key goal is to empower these marketing professionals to build and manage their websites independently without relying on developers or having to use the command line or an IDE.
2. Extending Drupal's presence in the mid-market segment, targeting projects with total budgets between $30,000 and $120,000 USD (€25,000 to €100,000).

Drupal Starshot will differentiate itself from competitors by providing:

1. A thoughtfully designed platform for marketers, balancing ease of use with flexibility. It includes smart defaults, best practices for common marketing tasks, marketing-focused editorial tools, and helpful learning resources.
2. A growth-oriented approach. Start simple with Drupal Starshot's user-friendly tools, and unlock advanced features as your site grows or you gain expertise. With sophisticated content modeling, efficient content reuse across channels, and robust integrations with other leading marketing technologies, ambitious marketers won't face the limitations of other CMSs and will have the flexibility to scale their site as needed.
3. AI-assisted site building tools to simplify complex tasks, making Drupal accessible to a wider range of users.
4. Drupal's existing competitive advantages such as extensibility, scalability, security, accessibility, multilingual support, and more.

### What about ambitious site builders?

In the past, we used the term [ambitious site builders](https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-site-builders) to describe Drupal's target audience. Although this term doesn't appear in the product strategy document, it remains relevant.

While the strategy document is publicly available, it is primarily an internal guide. It outlines our plans but doesn't dictate our marketing language. Our product strategy's language purposly aligns with terms used by our target users, based on persona research and interviews.

To me, "ambitious site builders" includes all Drupal users, from those working with Drupal Core (more technically skilled) to those working with Drupal Starshot (less technical). Both groups are ambitious, with Drupal Starshot specifically targeting "ambitious marketers" or "ambitious no-code developers".

### Give feedback

The product strategy is a living document, and we value input. We invite you to share your thoughts, suggestions, and questions in the [product strategy feedback issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/starshot/issues/3466424) within the [Drupal Starshot issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/starshot).

### Thank you

I'd like to thank the Drupal Starshot leadership team, the Drupal Starshot Advisory Council, and the Drupal Core Committers for their input on the strategy. I'm also grateful for the marketers who provided feedback on our strategy, helping us refine our approach.
