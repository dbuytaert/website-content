Though the games have only one more day to go (they were from October 3rd to October 14th this month), the [XIX Commonwealth Games](http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/) website runs on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org), and looks great. This 2010 Commonwealth Games were held in Delhi, and is the largest multi-sport event conducted to date in Delhi and India. Certainly a big win for Drupal!
