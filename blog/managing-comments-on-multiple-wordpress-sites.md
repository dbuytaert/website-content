There is a pursuit we all share; not having to deal with spammers. The promise of a clean spam-free web.

With that in mind, I'm pleased to announce that we released a new version of the [Mollom plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/). Mollom is an anti-spam solution for websites that offers some unique features not available in other solutions like [Akismet](http://akismet.com). For example, the new [Mollom plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mollom/) ships with complete support for the [Mollom Content Moderation Platform](https://www.mollom.com/moderation) – enabling you to moderate all of your WordPress sites from a single unified interface.

This is a great feature for organizations that have many sites. If you have 20 WordPress sites and 10 Drupal sites, you can now moderate these sites from a single user interface that offers powerful moderation workflows.

The new WordPress plugin leverages [Mollom's PHP library](https://github.com/Mollom/MollomPHP) that implements [Mollom REST API](https://www.mollom.com/api). The library is the basis for the [Mollom module for Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/project/mollom) but was designed to be reused by other systems. If you have a content management system other than Drupal or WordPress, you can also connect it with the [Mollom Content Moderation Platform](https://www.mollom.com/moderation).

Give it a try! You may like it.
