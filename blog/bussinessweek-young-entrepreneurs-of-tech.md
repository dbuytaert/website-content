# BussinessWeek's Young Entrepreneurs of Tech

It is a real honor and privilege that [BusinessWeek](http://businessweek.com) included me on [their list of top 30-and-under innovators for 2008](https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/technology/content/apr2008/tc20080417_388737.htm). I'm very happy to see [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org) getting this level of recognition from the business world. What BusinessWeek only hints at, though, is the importance of all the thousands of people, including my new colleagues at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), who are working every day to make Drupal great. This is a big milestone for Drupal so congratulations to all of you.
