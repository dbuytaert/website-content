Last week at [DrupalCon Boston](https://dri.es/drupalcon-boston) I gave my traditional state of Drupal presentation [in front of 850 Drupalistas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/sooz/2307344699/). The video of the presentation is provided below, and you can download a [copy of my slides](https://dri.es/files/state-of-drupal-march-2008.pdf) (PDF, 15 MB) as well. The video is available in alternative encoding formats from [archive.org](http://archive.org/details/DrupalconBoston2008-TheStateOfDrupal).

Topics I talked about: the Drupal 6 release, the state of our union, the need for a drupal.org redesign, the Drupal 7 killer release, the Drupal 7 development cycle, usability, test-driven development, the future of Drupal and the semantic web, etc. There is a lot of material in this presentation and during the course of the next few weeks, I plan to decompose this presentation in a number of extended blog posts. *Stay tuned!*
