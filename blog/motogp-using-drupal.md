MotoGP is the world's premier motorcycling championship, with a season of 18 Grands Prix in 14 countries bringing together the world's top motorcycle manufacturers such as Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki, Ducati, Kawasaki, Aprilia and KTM - plus an elite crop of riders from every corner of the globe. Their website just relaunched on [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org): see <http://www.motogp.com>. Rumor has it that on racing days, they serve up to 2 million pages a day. *Yowza!*
