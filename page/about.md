  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>My name is Dries Buytaert (he/him).</p>

  <p>I'm the Founder of <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. Drupal is Open Source software for building websites and digital experiences. Currently, around 2% of all websites worldwide are built with Drupal.  In the enterprise, that number is 1 out of 10 websites. Drupal is one of the largest and most active Open Source projects in the world. I've been working on Drupal for more than two decades, and continue to lead the project today as Drupal's Project Lead.</p>

  <p>In 2007, I co-founded <a href="https://www.acquia.com">Acquia</a> and helped it grow to around 1,400 employees and $350M+ in annual revenue.  Acquia is a SaaS company that offers solutions to create, manage and optimize digital customer experiences. As Acquia's co-founder, I also serve as a Board Member and hold the dual positions of Chief Technology Officer and Chief Strategy Officer.</p>

  <p>I'm a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Global_Leaders">Young Global Leader</a> at the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a>.</p>

  <p>I hold a PhD in computer science and engineering from <a href="http://ugent.be">Ghent University</a>.</p>

  <p>I was born and raised in Antwerp (Belgium), but moved to <span class="p-locality">Boston</span> (<span class="p-country-name">United States</span>) in 2010.</p>
