  <h3>Introduction</h3>

My name is Dries Buytaert (he/him).

I'm the Founder of [Drupal](https://drupal.org). Drupal is Open Source software for building websites and digital experiences. Currently, about 2% of all websites worldwide are built with Drupal. In the enterprise, that number is 1 out of 10 websites. Drupal is one of the largest and most active Open Source projects in the world. I've been working on Drupal for more than two decades, and continue to lead the project today as Drupal's Project Lead.

In 2007, I co-founded [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com), a SaaS company that helps organizations create, manage, and optimize digital customer experiences on Drupal. I currently serve as Executive Chair and have been on Acquia's board since the early days. Previously, I spent 18 years as Chief Technology Officer, later also serving as Chief Strategy Officer, and helped grow the company from zero to around 1,400 employees and more than $350 million in annual revenue.

I'm a [Young Global Leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Global_Leaders) at the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/).

I hold a PhD in computer science and engineering from [Ghent University](http://ugent.be).

I was born and raised in Antwerp (Belgium), but moved to <span class="p-locality">Boston</span> (<span class="p-country-name">United States</span>) in 2010.

I try to [live by a set of simple principles](https://dri.es/principles-for-life).

### My passions

I really like building things; companies, software, and more. Creating and learning is what makes me happy.

I love to read or study at least one hour a day. I study technology, financial markets, and more.

I have a passion for photography. Take a look at [my photo stream](/photos) or [my photo albums](/albums).

I also love travel and adventure, especially hiking and skiing. And no matter where an adventure takes me, food is often a key part of the trip. I consider travel and food an essential part of life and community.

  <h3>My work</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <div class="title p-job-title">Co-founder, Executive Chair, and Board Member, Acquia</div>
  <div class="date">2007 - current</div>
<p><a href="https://www.acquia.com">Acquia</a> helps enterprises build digital experiences using Drupal. I co-founded Acquia in 2007,  and we were early pioneers of a now-common business model: open source software delivered as a cloud service.</p>
<p>In our first eight years, Acquia was one of the fastest-growing startups in the United States. We raised over <a href="https://dri.es/acquia-raises-55-million-series-g">$180 million</a> in venture capital. In 2019, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/vista-is-said-to-buy-majority-stake-in-acquia-in-1-billion-deal">Vista acquired a majority stake in Acquia</a>. Today, Acquia has over $350 million in annual revenue and around 1,400 employees.</p>
<p>I now serve as Executive Chair. From 2007 to 2025, I served as Chief Technology Officer, and later also as Chief Strategy Officer. My responsibilities included product strategy, product management, M&A, product marketing, architecture, design and user experience, and more.</p>
</li>
  <li>
  <div class="title">Angel investor</div>
  <div class="date">2013 - current</div>
  <p>
  I make <a href="/angel-investments">angel investments</a> in startups, with a focus on technology. Notable investments include Toast (IPO), Circle (IPO), and Oqton (acquired by 3D Systems).
</p>
</li>
  <li>
  <div class="title">Co-founder and CEO of Mollom (acquired by Acquia in 2012)</div>
  <div class="date">2008 - 2012</div>
  <p>
  <a href="https://mollom.com">Mollom</a> is an intelligent content moderation platform for user-generated content on websites. Mollom uses machine learning to <a href="https://dri.es/website-spam-and-moderation-queues">identify spam, profanity or generally unwanted content</a> in comment systems and online discussion forums. Mollom has blocked over 15 billion spam comments across 60,000 websites. We bootstrapped Mollom with no external capital and <a href="https://dri.es/mollom-acquired-by-acquia">sold Mollom to Acquia</a> after 4.5 years.

  <li>
  <div class="title p-job-title">Co-founder and Board Member of the Drupal Association</div>
  <div class="date">2006 - current</div>
  <p>
  The <a href="https://association.drupal.org">Drupal Association</a> is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting and advancing <a href="https://drupal.com">Drupal</a>.  The Drupal Association has around 20 full-time employees. Between 2006 and 2017, I was the Chairman and President. Today, I serve on the Executive Committee, Strategy Committee and Nominating Committee.
</p>
</li>
  <li>
  <div class="title p-job-title">Founder and Project Lead of Drupal</div>
  <div class="date">2000 - current</div>
  <p>I founded <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> in 2000 and have served as its Project Lead ever since. Over time, Drupal has grown into a general-purpose platform used by governments, enterprises, and non-profits around the world. I focus on the long-term health of the project, including technical direction, governance, and community sustainability. Today, Drupal powers about two percent of the world's websites. With roughly 10,000 contributors each year, it is one of the largest and most active open source projects in the world.</p>
