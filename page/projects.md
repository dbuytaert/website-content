# Projects

- [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) – I'm the Founder and Project Lead of Drupal. Drupal is Open Source software for building websites and digital experiences. I've been working on Drupal for more than 20 years.
- [HTTP Headers Analyzer](/headers) – Learn how HTTP headers work, and use the analyzer to improve the performance and security of your websites. Used more than 2,500 times a day.
- [Solar-powered website](https://solar.dri.es) – I've created a self-hosted website running on a Raspberry Pi, powered entirely by solar energy. Check out the [live dashboard](https://dri.es/sensors/solar) to see real-time data on the solar panel's performance.
- [Electronics](https://dri.es/tag/electronics) – I've been exploring basic DIY electronics and data visualization, creating projects like [thermometers](https://dri.es/building-my-own-temperature-and-humidity-monitor) and [CO<sub>2</sub> monitors](https://dri.es/building-my-own-co2-monitor). Example: track [our basement's temperature](https://dri.es/sensors/basement-belgium) on my website.
