# Leica lenses

I've been shooting with Leica M cameras for a few years. This page lists the lenses I use today and vintage lenses I would love to try.

### Lenses I currently own

<table>
  <tr>
   <th>Lens</th>
   <th>Years</th>
   <th>Notes</th>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summilux-M 35 mm f/1.4 ASPH FLE</td>
   <td>2010 – 2022</td>
   <td>Sharp, fast, and versatile. My everyday lens.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summilux-M 50 mm f/1.4 ASPH</td>
   <td>2023 – Present</td>
   <td>Sharp, fast, and balanced with beautiful color and contrast.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Noctilux-M 50 mm f/0.95</td>
   <td>2008 – Present</td>
   <td>Dreamy and full of depth, but not always sharp.</td>
 </tr>
</table>

### Vintage lenses I'd love to try or buy

Lately, I've become more interested in vintage lenses than new ones.  Their way of handling light and color is softer and has more character than modern glass. My Noctilux showed me how much beauty there is in imperfection. These older lenses can be hard to find and often confusing to identify, so I'm keeping track of them here.

  <tr>
   <td>Leica Elmarit-M 28 mm f/2.8 v4</td>
   <td>1992 – 2006</td>
   <td>Compact and sharp with minimal distortion. A clean, classic wide-angle.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summicron-M 35 mm f/2 v4, German-made ("Bokeh King")</td>
   <td>1979 – 1999</td>
   <td>Famous for its smooth bokeh and gentle rendering. Avoid Canadian version.</td>

  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summilux-M 35 mm f/1.4 AA (Double Aspherical)</td>
   <td>1990 – 1994</td>

 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summitar 50 mm f/2</td>
   <td>1939 – 1955</td>
   <td>Soft and nostalgic, with the kind of glow only old glass gives.</td>
 </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Leica Summicron 50 mm f/2 Rigid v2</td>
   <td>1956 – 1968</td>
   <td>A crisp, confident lens that defined Leica's look for years.</td>
 </tr>
